# Chapter 25: Annie's Truth

Chris was still holding my hands, waiting for me to say something. To tell him whether I could believe what he'd just said, whether I could take the leap he was asking for.

But I needed him to understand the full truth first. Not just the surface fear of social differences, but the deeper thing underneath. The thing that had kept me invisible for so long.

"Can I tell you something?" My voice came out shaky. "Something I've never really said out loud before?"

"Anything," Chris said immediately.

I pulled my hands from his gently, needing the space to get the words out. I walked to the window, looking out at the dark street, seeing my reflection in the glass—smudged makeup, ruined hair, secondhand dress. The girl I'd always been, underneath all the attempts to be something more.

"I've spent my whole life being invisible," I said quietly. "Not because people were cruel or because I was bullied. Just because I was... unremarkable. The second daughter. The one who wasn't as pretty or confident or special as Diane. The girl behind the counter. I was part of the scenery, you know? Present but not important."

I heard Chris move behind me but he didn't interrupt.

"And the thing is," I continued, my voice getting rougher, "I made myself that way. It wasn't just other people deciding I didn't matter. I decided it first. I looked at Diane and my mother's expectations and girls like Sandra Mitchell, and I decided that since I couldn't compete, I just... wouldn't. I'd stay small. Stay quiet. Stay safe behind the counter where I knew exactly what was expected of me."

My reflection blurred as tears filled my eyes again.

"So when you started coming into the shop, when you talked to me like I was someone worth knowing..." I had to stop, swallow past the lump in my throat. "I didn't know what to do with that. Part of me wanted to believe it so badly. But the louder part—the part that's been in control my whole life—kept saying it couldn't be real. Because girls like me don't get boys like you. We don't get beautiful things. We don't get seen."

I turned to face him finally. Chris was standing a few feet away, his expression devastated.

"Tonight at the dance," I said, "when Sandra told me how kind you are, how you include everyone, how generous your spirit is—it confirmed everything I'd been telling myself. That your attention was charity. That I was a summer project. That this would end the moment you realized I was just... ordinary."

"Annie—"

"And then Jennifer called me 'the help,'" I continued, needing to get it all out, "and it was like every fear I'd ever had just crystallized into truth. That's what I am to your world, Chris. The help. The girl who serves your friends their malts and then goes back behind the counter where she belongs. And trying to be anything else—trying to be your equal, trying to deserve you—it felt like the most arrogant, foolish thing I could do."

I wrapped my arms around myself, feeling exposed and raw.

"So I ran. Because being in that room with all those people who saw exactly what I was—exactly how much I didn't belong—it was unbearable. And coming here, to the malt shop, felt like admitting defeat. Like accepting that this is my place and I should have never tried to leave it."

The words hung in the air between us. I'd laid out every ugly, shameful truth about myself—the self-doubt, the self-imposed limitations, the fundamental belief that I wasn't worthy of being seen or wanted or loved.

And I waited for Chris to realize that this was too much. That a girl who couldn't even believe in her own worth wasn't someone he wanted to fight for.

Instead, he crossed the distance between us in three steps.

"Do you know what I hear when you say all of that?" His voice was intense. "I hear someone who's been told—by society, by circumstances, by her own mind—that she doesn't matter. And I hear someone who believed it so deeply that she built her whole life around that lie."

"It's not a lie," I protested. "Chris, look at me. Really look. I'm not special. I'm not remarkable. I'm just—"

"Stop." He grabbed my shoulders, not roughly but firmly. "Stop diminishing yourself. Stop deciding you're not worthy before anyone else can. Stop giving everyone else the power to define your value."

"But—"

"Annie, you say you're ordinary. That you're unremarkable. That you're just the girl behind the counter." Chris's eyes were blazing. "But do you know what I see? I see someone who notices things no one else does. Who remembers that Mrs. Henderson orders extra whipped cream on Tuesdays because she's had a bad day. Who makes art on napkins and then throws it away because she's convinced it doesn't matter. Who has so much talent and thoughtfulness and quiet strength that it takes my breath away."

"That's not—"

"You're not ordinary," he insisted. "You've convinced yourself you are because it's safer than believing you're special and risking disappointment. But Annie, you ARE special. Not because of what you do or where you come from or whether you fit into some arbitrary social category. You're special because you're you. Because when you talk about art, your whole face lights up. Because you see people—really see them—in a way most people never bother to. Because you're brave enough to show up behind that counter every day and do work you're good at even though you dream of doing something else."

He moved closer, his voice dropping.

"You say you're invisible, but you're the most visible person in the world to me. I can't walk into this shop without seeing you. I can't go a day without thinking about our conversations. I can't imagine my future without wondering if you'll be in it. So don't tell me you're ordinary or unremarkable or just the girl behind the counter. Because to me, you're everything."

The tears were falling freely now. "But the differences are still real. Your family, my family, the money, the expectations—"

"Are all just obstacles. And yes, they're real obstacles. I'm not denying that." Chris cupped my face in his hands, thumbs brushing away tears. "But the question isn't whether the obstacles exist. It's whether we're going to let them stop us before we even try. Whether you're going to keep hiding behind the excuse of social class to avoid the real scary thing."

"What real scary thing?"

"Being seen," he said simply. "Really, truly seen. Not as the invisible girl or the malt shop worker or Diane's less-remarkable sister. But as Annie—talented, thoughtful, worthy Annie—who deserves to be chosen and fought for and loved."

My breath caught. "Chris..."

"You asked me earlier what this is between us," he continued. "Whether it's charity or pity or kindness to someone less fortunate. And I need you to hear this, Annie. Really hear it." His eyes locked on mine. "I don't want to be with you because I'm a good person who helps the disadvantaged. I want to be with you because you make me want to be honest about who I am. Because when I'm with you, I don't have to perform or pretend. Because loving you—"

He stopped, seemed to realize what he'd almost said.

"Loving me?" I whispered.

Chris took a breath. "Yes. Loving you. That's what this is, Annie. That's what I've been trying to tell you all summer but didn't have the words for. I love that you hide your sketches like they're secrets. I love that you remember everyone's orders and their stories. I love your quiet strength and your artistic soul and the way you see the world. I love who I am when I'm with you."

I was crying openly now, but for the first time tonight, they weren't tears of humiliation or pain. They were something else entirely.

"But most of all," Chris said, his voice rough with emotion, "I love that underneath all your fear and self-doubt, there's this girl who's starting to believe she deserves more. Who said yes to the dance even though she was terrified. Who kept showing up every day to work she's outgrown because she's responsible and loyal. Who draws beauty on napkins and then saves just a few of them, like maybe someday she'll let herself believe they matter."

He leaned his forehead against mine.

"You matter, Annie. To me, to the people who know you, to the world even if it hasn't figured that out yet. And the only question is whether you're going to keep letting your fear decide what you deserve, or whether you're finally going to choose yourself. Choose your talent. Choose your dreams. Choose the possibility that maybe, just maybe, you're worth fighting for."

I stood there in his arms, in the dark malt shop, and felt something fundamental shift inside me.

He was right. The social differences were real, but they weren't the real obstacle. The real obstacle was me. My fear. My conviction that I wasn't worthy of being seen or chosen or loved.

And standing here, with Chris looking at me like I was something precious, I realized I had a choice.

I could keep hiding. Keep telling myself I was ordinary, that dreams were for other girls, that being invisible was safer than being seen.

Or I could choose to believe him. Choose to fight for this. Choose to believe that maybe—just maybe—I deserved beautiful things.

Even if it scared me.

Especially if it scared me.

"I'm terrified," I whispered.

"I know," Chris said. "Me too."

"What if this doesn't work?"

"What if it does?"

And in the end, that was the question that mattered.

What if it did?
