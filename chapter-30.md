# Chapter 30: Public Declaration

The afternoon rush was in full swing when I tied on my apron the next day. The familiar rhythm of scooping ice cream, pumping chocolate syrup, and spinning the malt mixer should have felt the same as it had all summer.

But it didn't.

Something had shifted overnight. When Mrs. Henderson ordered her Tuesday special with extra whipped cream, I met her eyes and smiled instead of ducking my head. When the Johnson twins fought over who got the cherry on their sundae, I laughed and gave them each an extra cherry.

Betty noticed immediately.

"You're different today," she said during a brief lull. "Walking taller. What happened?"

I felt heat rise to my cheeks, remembering Chris's lips on mine, the way he'd said he loved me.

"Nothing," I said, but I was smiling.

"Uh-huh." Betty grinned. "That boy finally tell you what anyone with eyes could see?"

"Maybe."

Ruth appeared from the back. "Tell her what?"

"Annie's got a boyfriend," Betty announced.

"The college boy?" Ruth sighed romantically. "I knew it. The way he looks at you—like you're the only person in the room."

Mr. Henderson shuffled in for his afternoon coffee. "What's all this commotion?"

"Annie's got a beau," Betty informed him.

"The Donovan boy?" Mr. Henderson nodded approvingly. "Good head on his shoulders. You picked well, Annie girl."

I had picked well—by finally choosing to believe I deserved to be chosen.

The clock on the wall read 2:58.

My heart started beating faster. Chris had said three o'clock. He'd said he was going to make sure everyone knew.

Had he meant it? Or had he reconsidered?

The door chimed.

Chris walked in, and our eyes met immediately. He looked nervous and determined.

"Hi," he said, approaching the counter.

"Hi." My voice came out breathier than I intended. "The usual?"

"Yeah. Cherry malt." He smiled, and I saw the echo of last night in his expression.

I reached for a glass, but Chris held up a hand.

"Before you make that—there's something I need to do first."

He turned and walked toward the jukebox. The deliberate way he moved made several customers glance up. Chris was a regular here, but something about his purposeful stride caught their attention.

I felt Betty move closer, felt Ruth pause.

Chris fed a nickel into the jukebox. The opening notes of "Earth Angel" filled the shop.

Then Chris turned to face the room, his eyes finding mine across the distance.

"This song," he said, voice carrying clearly over the music, "is dedicated to Annie Palmer."

The shop went quiet. Even the jukebox seemed to dim slightly, though the music kept playing.

"Annie is the most talented, genuine, beautiful person in Seabreeze," Chris continued, speaking to the whole room but looking only at me. "She makes the best cherry malts I've ever tasted and draws the most incredible sketches I've ever seen. She notices things about people that nobody else does. She cares whether Mrs. Henderson is having a good day. She makes this shop feel like home."

My face was burning. Every person in the shop was looking at me now—customers at the booths, people at the counter, tourists at the window tables. The Johnson twins had stopped arguing about cherries. Mr. Henderson had paused with his coffee cup halfway to his lips.

"And I'm the luckiest person in the world," Chris said, his voice getting softer but no less clear, "because she's giving me a chance. Because she's brave enough to believe that maybe this could work. Because she's choosing to be seen instead of hiding behind that counter where she's been invisible for too long."

He was still looking at me, and I saw everything in his eyes—last night's kiss, this morning's courage, tomorrow's possibilities.

"So this song is for Annie," Chris finished. "And I want everyone to know: she's not just the girl behind the counter. She's the girl I'm falling in love with."

The silence stretched for one more heartbeat.

Then Mrs. Henderson started clapping, and several other customers joined in. Someone whistled. The Johnson twins giggled.

My heart was pounding. My old instinct screamed at me to run, to hide, to disappear like I'd always done.

Except I didn't want to.

I looked at Chris by the jukebox and saw pride, not pity. Mr. Henderson's face showed approval. Betty was grinning. Ruth looked ready to cry from the romance of it all.

Some people were whispering—I caught sideways glances, raised eyebrows. Not everyone would approve.

But I found I didn't care as much as I'd thought I would.

Because Chris was right. I couldn't control what other people thought. I could only control what I believed about myself. And for the first time in my life, I believed I was worth seeing.

Worth choosing.

Worth loving.

Chris walked back to the counter, "Earth Angel" still playing behind him. His eyes never left mine.

"So," he said, sliding onto his usual stool. "About that cherry malt?"

My hands trembled slightly as I reached for a glass, but not from fear. From anticipation, joy, the exhilaration of standing in the light instead of the shadows.

I made his malt with practiced movements. Scoop the ice cream, pump the syrup, add the milk, blend until smooth.

This one felt different.

I set the glass in front of Chris with its perfect swirl of whipped cream and bright red cherry on top.

"One cherry malt," I said. "On the house."

"You don't have to—"

"I want to." I smiled. "Consider it a thank you. For the song. For the speech. For everything."

Chris reached across the counter and took my hand, right there in front of everyone. His fingers were warm and solid, and the gesture felt both intimate and public—a choice, a claim, a promise.

"You don't have to thank me for telling the truth," he said quietly. "About how remarkable you are. About how I feel. That's not a favor, Annie. That's just me being honest."

"Earth Angel" reached its final verse.

I squeezed Chris's hand once, then released it as the bell chimed with a new customer. But the warmth of his touch stayed with me as I turned to take the order.

The afternoon continued its busy rhythm. Betty made pointed comments about young love. Ruth sighed dreamily. Mr. Henderson gave me a subtle nod before leaving.

But something fundamental had changed.

I wasn't hiding my notebook anymore when I sketched during lulls. Wasn't ducking my head when customers spoke to me. Wasn't trying to disappear into the wallpaper the way I'd done for so many years.

Because I finally understood something: I was never actually invisible.

I'd just needed someone to show me I was worth seeing. And I'd needed to find the courage to believe it.

Chris stayed for an hour, nursing his cherry malt and talking to me between customers. Plans for the rest of summer, art school applications, what time I got off work.

Normal things. Boyfriend things.

The word still felt strange and wonderful: boyfriend. We were together, publicly and officially, and everyone knew.

When he finally stood to leave, he leaned across the counter.

"Same time tomorrow?" he asked.

"Three o'clock," I confirmed, smiling. "I'll have your cherry malt ready."

"Perfect." He paused, then added more quietly, "I meant what I said. All of it. You're not invisible, Annie. Not to me. Not to anyone who's actually paying attention."

"I know," I said, and realized I meant it. "I'm starting to believe it."

"Good." He grinned. "Because I'm going to keep telling you until you do. Fair warning."

I watched him leave, watched through the window as he walked down the street toward the hardware store.

A customer approached—one of the summer tourists.

"That was lovely," she said. "That boy dedicating a song to you. Like something out of a movie."

"Yeah," I agreed. "It was."

"You make a sweet couple. And I'll have a chocolate sundae with extra fudge, please."

I smiled and reached for a bowl. "Coming right up."

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur of orders and clean-up. Betty kept making knowing comments. Ruth asked if I wanted to talk until I finally gave her a brief version that satisfied her romantic soul.

But as I untied my apron and prepared to head home, I paused by the window.

The summer stretched ahead, full of possibility. Art school applications to fill out. A boyfriend who saw me for who I really was. The knowledge that I belonged in my own story.

For the first time, I believed in my own happy ending.

Not because Prince Charming had swept me off my feet. Not because everything was suddenly perfect.

But because I'd chosen to step into the light. Chosen to be seen. Chosen to believe I was worthy of being the main character in my own life.

I smiled, turned off the lights, and locked the door.

Tomorrow, Chris would walk in at three o'clock and order a cherry malt. And I'd be here, standing behind the counter but no longer hiding.

Standing in my own light, finally visible.

Finally seen.

Finally myself.
