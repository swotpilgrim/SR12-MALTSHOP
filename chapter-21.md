# Chapter 21: Crisis Point

I was still standing alone when Sandra Mitchell appeared at my elbow, offering me a cup of punch.

"Chris seems to have disappeared. The punch line gets quite long." She sipped her own drink, her gaze sweeping the room with practiced ease. "So, how did you and Chris meet?"

"At the malt shop," I said. "Where I work."

"Oh, that's right. Such a charming little place. Very... nostalgic."

The way she said "little" made it clear exactly how she viewed both the shop and me.

"Chris has been spending a lot of time there this summer," Sandra continued. "He must really love those malts you make."

"I suppose so."

"It's sweet, really. Chris has always been like that—kind to everyone. Even as a child, he'd include the kids others ignored. Such a generous spirit."

Kind to everyone. The words landed like a stone in my stomach.

"I've known Chris since we were six. Our families have been friends forever. We dated briefly in high school. Nothing serious, but everyone always assumed we'd end up together eventually."

She laughed lightly, like it was charming instead of a knife between my ribs.

"So what are your plans after summer? College?"

"No. I'll keep working at the malt shop. Maybe become a manager."

"Oh." That flicker of pity. "Well, that's... practical. Not everyone is cut out for college. I'm heading to Bryn Mawr. Pre-law."

"That must be exciting," I managed.

"It is. Though I'll miss Seabreeze. There's something special about summer here, don't you think? All the families coming back, the tradition of it all." Her eyes drifted across the room. "It's nice that Chris is being so inclusive this summer, bringing different kinds of people to these events. It shows real character."

Different kinds of people. Like I was some sort of charity case, some good deed Chris was performing to prove his moral fiber.

"Sandra!" Someone called from across the room.

"Oh, I should go. Lovely chatting with you, Annie. Hope you're enjoying your first Summer Social." Sandra touched my arm briefly. "Chris is lucky to have someone who appreciates him for who he is, not just his family name."

She drifted away, leaving me with my half-empty cup and growing certainty that I'd made a horrible mistake.

Kind to everyone. Being inclusive. Different kinds of people.

Every word carefully chosen, polite enough that I couldn't call it cruel, but pointed enough to make the message clear: I was Chris's summer project, his act of kindness to the less fortunate.

Not his equal.

Just someone he was being kind to.

I was still processing Sandra's words when Chris returned with fresh punch.

"Sorry that took so long. Mrs. Mitchell—" He stopped, studying my face. "Annie? What's wrong?"

"Nothing. Sandra was just keeping me company."

Chris's expression tightened. "What did she say?"

"Just conversation. How we met, my plans." I forced a smile. "She's very nice."

"Annie—"

"Chris! There you are!" Tommy appeared with a pretty blonde. "You remember Jennifer from the club? Your mother's looking for you. Wants to introduce you to someone."

Jennifer smiled at me politely. "Oh, I don't think we've met. I'm Jennifer."

"Annie Palmer," Chris said.

"Lovely to meet you. That's a darling dress. Very vintage."

Vintage. Another word for secondhand, for not-quite-right.

"Come on, Chris. You know how your mother gets."

Chris looked torn, his hand finding mine. "Just a minute. I'll be right back."

"Go ahead. I'm fine."

He squeezed my hand, then let Tommy pull him toward his mother. I watched him slip seamlessly into that world of pleasant conversation, felt the distance between us stretch.

He belonged here. This was his world.

And I was just a summer distraction.

I moved toward the edge of the room, trying to make myself smaller. Maybe if I stayed quiet until Chris was done, we could leave early.

A burst of laughter nearby. Tommy and Jennifer stood with another couple, their backs to me. Their conversation carried.

"I was surprised when I heard Chris was bringing someone," Jennifer said. "I thought he and Sandra would finally get together."

"Everyone did," Tommy agreed. "But Chris has always been unpredictable."

"It's sweet though. Giving the malt shop girl a nice evening. Very charitable."

"Bringing the help to the Summer Social? That's quite a statement."

They laughed—casual amusement, like Chris had done something unconventional and mildly absurd.

The help.

The words hit me like a slap.

That's what I was to them. Not Chris's date. Just "the help," the girl who served them, given a night off to play dress-up.

I looked across the room to where Chris stood with his mother and the mayor, laughing at something someone had said. He looked completely at ease, completely in his element. This was his world. These were his people.

And I was the girl who made his malts.

The room felt too small, too hot. The music too loud, the lights too bright. Every smile felt like judgment.

I couldn't breathe.

I needed to get out—before I cried in front of everyone. Before Chris came back and saw the truth: bringing me here had been a mistake.

Chris was still talking to his mother, his back to me. No one was watching.

No one would notice if I left.

My vision blurred with unshed tears. I moved toward the door, weaving between clusters of people who barely registered my existence.

The cool night air hit my face as I pushed through the exit. The sounds of the dance faded behind me—music and laughter.

I started walking.

Away from the community center. Away from Sandra's careful words and Jennifer's casual cruelty. Away from the evidence of everything I'd always known.

I didn't belong in that world.

I never would.

My feet carried me down familiar streets. Past darkened shops, past the boardwalk, toward the one place that had always felt safe.

The malt shop.

My hands shook as I dug for my key. The lock clicked open and I slipped inside, leaning against the door.

The malt shop was dark and quiet, smelling of vanilla and chocolate. The chrome counter gleamed in the moonlight. This was my world—chrome and vinyl, malts and sundaes, being good at something simple.

This was where I belonged.

Not at the Summer Social in a borrowed dress, pretending to be someone I wasn't.

I sank onto a red vinyl stool, still in my blue dress and Diane's pearls. My reflection in the chrome showed makeup smudged, hair coming loose from its pins.

The tears I'd been holding back finally came.

I'd been a fool. A fool to think I could be more than the malt shop girl. A fool to believe Chris's attention meant something beyond summer kindness.

This was reality. And I didn't have a place in his world.

I took off Diane's pearls carefully, folding them in my hand.

The door rattled.

Through the window, I saw Chris in his suit, his face concerned. He must have noticed I was gone.

Part of me wanted to hide. But he'd already seen me.

I stood on shaking legs and unlocked the door.

"Annie." He came inside, eyes scanning my face, seeing the tears. "What happened? Why did you leave?"

I couldn't find the words. How could I explain that his world had chewed me up in an hour? That every fear I'd had been confirmed?

"I'm sorry," I whispered. "I just... I needed to leave."

We stood there in the dim malt shop—him in his perfect suit, me in my secondhand dress with my facade crumbling.

"Talk to me," he said softly. "Please. What happened?"

I knew I had to tell him the truth. Even if it meant ending whatever this was.

I didn't belong in his world.

And trying to pretend otherwise was only going to hurt us both.
