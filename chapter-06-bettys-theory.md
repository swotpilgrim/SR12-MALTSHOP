# Chapter 6: Betty's Theory

The morning shift on Thursday starts like any other—unlock the shop, turn on the lights, feed the jukebox its first nickel. Except Betty arrives early, which is unusual.

"Okay," she says, dropping her purse behind the counter. "We need to talk."

I'm arranging malt cups, already defensive. "About what?"

"About Chris Donovan."

"There's nothing to talk about."

"Annie." Betty plants both hands on the counter. "He's been coming here every single day for almost a week. He stays longer each time. He asks personal questions. He lights up when he sees you. And yesterday he literally told you that the malt isn't the only reason he's coming back."

"He likes the atmosphere."

"The atmosphere." Betty's voice is flat.

"Yes. The shop has a nice—"

"Stop. Just stop. I love you, but you're being deliberately obtuse."

I busy myself with the syrup bottles, lining them up with unnecessary precision. "I don't know what you want me to say."

"I want you to admit that Chris Donovan is interested in you romantically. That he's—I don't even know the word for it—courting you? Is that old-fashioned? He's courting you with daily cherry malts and meaningful conversation."

My hands still on the bottles. "That's ridiculous."

"Why?"

"Because boys like Chris Donovan don't—" I stop, not wanting to finish the sentence.

"Don't what?" Betty's voice has gone softer now, less frustrated and more concerned. "Don't like girls like you?"

I don't answer, which is answer enough.

Betty takes my hands, forcing me to look at her. "Annie Palmer, listen to me. You are smart, talented, kind. You make the best cherry malts in Delaware. You have this quiet strength that some people, like a certain college boy, absolutely notice. So why exactly wouldn't Chris be interested in you?"

"Because..." I struggle. "Because he's from the Donovan family. They own businesses. They matter. He goes to university. And I'm—I make malts. I'm nobody."

"You're not nobody."

"My sister is beautiful and confident. My mother looks at me like she's wondering where she went wrong. I hide behind counters and throw away my drawings. That's who I am. Chris should be dating Sandra Mitchell. Not me."

Betty's eyes are shiny. "Okay. You don't think you're good enough."

"I'm just being realistic."

"No, you're being scared. But Annie, what if Chris sees all the things you won't let yourself see? What if he genuinely likes you?"

"Then why?" The question bursts out. "Why would someone like him like someone like me?"

"Because maybe he wants something real. Maybe he's tired of girls who only see the Donovan name. Maybe he wants someone who listens when he talks about teaching. Maybe he wants someone who cares about making a perfect malt. Maybe he wants you, Annie. Just you."

I want to believe her. God, I want to believe her so badly it physically hurts.

"But what if I'm wrong?" I whisper. "What if I let myself think... think that he might like me, and then it turns out I completely misread everything? What if I'm just the malt shop girl who was convenient to talk to over the summer?"

"What if you're right?" Betty counters. "What if he does like you, and you're so busy convincing yourself it's impossible that you miss the whole thing?"

I don't have an answer for that.

The bell above the door chimes—Mr. Henderson arriving. Betty squeezes my hands once and lets go, returning to her side of the counter. We both busy ourselves with opening prep, but the conversation hangs between us, unresolved.

By the time three o'clock approaches, I'm tied in knots.

Betty's words have lodged themselves in my brain, refusing to be dismissed. *What if he genuinely likes you?* The possibility is terrifying and exhilarating in equal measure. Part of me wants to hide when Chris walks through that door. Part of me wants to demand answers, to ask directly what he wants, what this is.

But I'm a coward. So when the bell chimes at three o'clock and Chris walks in with his familiar smile and sawdust-dusted pants, I just smile back and reach for a glass.

"Cherry malt?"

"You're getting predictable," he teases, sitting at his usual stool.

"So are you."

"Predictably good taste in malts."

I make his drink on autopilot, my mind whirling. How does someone ask "do you like me?" without sounding like a child? How does someone say "I need to know if this means something" without risking everything?

When I set the malt in front of him, he studies my face. "You okay? You seem... somewhere else today."

"I'm fine."

"Annie." He says my name gently, like it matters. "You don't have to tell me. But you also don't have to pretend with me."

That's the problem, isn't it? With Chris, I don't feel like I have to pretend. I can be quiet or uncertain or overly serious, and he doesn't seem to mind. He sees me—really sees me—in a way that most people don't bother to.

"Can I ask you something?" The words come out before I can stop them.

"Always."

"Why do you keep coming here?"

He blinks, surprised. "I told you. The cherry malts are—"

"Besides the malts." I force myself to hold his gaze. "You said that's not the only reason. So what's the real reason?"

There's a beat of silence where I see him deciding something. Then he leans forward, elbows on the counter, and looks at me with those blue eyes that see too much.

"Honestly?"

I nod, not trusting my voice.

"Because when I'm here, with you, I don't have to be Chris Donovan, future hardware store owner, dutiful son, the guy with all the right prospects. I can just be Chris. Who likes books and wants to teach and doesn't know what the hell he's doing with his life. You don't judge that. You just... listen. And you're real in a way most people aren't."

My heart is beating so hard I'm sure he can hear it.

"Plus," he adds, and there's something almost shy in his smile now, "you're really easy to talk to. And you have this smile—when you actually smile, not the customer service one but the real one—it's like watching someone turn on a light they've been keeping off. It's really nice, Annie. You're really nice."

I don't know what to do with that. With any of that.

"Oh," is all I manage.

"Did I make this weird?" He looks worried now. "I made this weird. Sorry. I just thought, since you asked—"

"No." I find my voice. "No, it's not weird. It's just... no one's ever said things like that to me before."

"Then people haven't been paying attention."

From across the shop, I can feel Betty's eyes on us. I know if I looked, she'd be grinning, probably doing some kind of triumphant gesture behind the customers' backs.

"I like talking to you too," I say quietly. "In case that wasn't obvious."

"It wasn't, actually." His smile is warm. "You're hard to read sometimes. I wasn't sure if I was being annoying, showing up every day."

"You're not annoying."

"Good." He takes a sip of his malt. "Because I plan to keep showing up. If that's okay."

"It's okay."

More than okay. But I can't quite say that yet.

We fall into easier conversation after that—he tells me about a near-disaster involving a paint spill at the store, I tell him about the regular customer who insists on exact change down to the penny. The knot in my chest loosens gradually, though Betty's question still echoes.

*What if he does like you, and you're so busy convincing yourself it's impossible that you miss the whole thing?*

When Chris leaves, Betty waits exactly three seconds before appearing at my side.

"Well?"

"He said I'm easy to talk to."

"And?"

"And that I'm real. And that he likes my smile."

Betty's entire face lights up. "Annie Palmer, that boy is gone for you."

"He didn't say—"

"He didn't have to! 'You're real,' 'I like your smile,' 'you're really nice'—Annie, those aren't things you say to your friendly neighborhood malt-maker. Those are things you say when you're interested."

"Maybe he just meant—"

"No. No more maybes. No more 'he probably just meant as friends' or 'he's just being nice.' He's interested in you. Romantically. I'm calling it. Official Betty ruling: Chris Donovan likes Annie Palmer."

Despite everything—all my doubts and fears and certainty that this can't be real—I feel a smile tugging at my lips.

"Official Betty ruling?"

"Absolutely official. I'm never wrong about these things."

"You thought Tommy Morrison liked Sandra Mitchell last summer, and he asked out her cousin."

"That was a statistical anomaly." Betty waves this away. "But this? This is clear as day. The boy likes you. The question is: do you like him back?"

I think about blue eyes and easy smiles. The way he makes hardware inventory sound interesting. How he listens when I talk like my words actually matter. The warmth in my chest every time the bell chimes at three o'clock.

"Yeah," I admit quietly. "I do."

Betty squeals and pulls me into a hug right there behind the counter, not caring that there are customers watching.

"Finally! Finally, you admit it! This is huge, Annie. Huge."

"It doesn't change anything," I protest, even as I return the hug. "I still don't know what to do. Or if he actually... I mean, liking my smile isn't the same as—"

"One step at a time," Betty says firmly. "Today, you admitted you like him. Tomorrow, you let yourself believe he might like you back. The day after that, maybe we work on you actually believing you deserve this."

"That sounds like a lot of days."

"Good thing summer's not over yet."

That night, lying in bed, I let myself replay the conversation. *You're really easy to talk to. You're real. You're really nice.*

Simple words. But the way he said them, looking directly at me with that open, honest expression—it felt like more than simple.

Betty's right. I am scared. Terrified, actually.

But maybe, just maybe, it's time to be scared and do it anyway.

Maybe it's time to let myself believe that Chris Donovan sees something in me worth coming back for every single day at three o'clock.

Maybe it's time to stop being invisible and let myself be seen.
