# Chapter 11: Art School Dreams

The next few days bring a subtle shift to our afternoon conversations. Chris still arrives at three o'clock like clockwork, still orders his cherry malt with that familiar smile, but now there's something deliberate in the way he settles onto his stool, like he's a man with a mission.

On Tuesday, he pulls a folded brochure from his pocket before I even finish making his malt.

"Philadelphia College of Art," he says, sliding it across the counter. "I picked this up at the library yesterday. They have an illustration program."

I stare at the glossy paper showing elegant brick buildings and students with easels. "Chris—"

"Just look at it," he says. "No pressure. Just information."

The brochure feels dangerous in my hands. I flip it open, seeing photographs of classrooms filled with natural light, students bent over drawing boards, finished artwork displayed on walls. There's a girl about my age working on a pen and ink drawing, her expression intensely focused.

"They offer scholarships," Chris continues, tapping a section on the back. "Based on portfolio submissions. Ten to fifteen pieces. You already have seven from your malt shop series, right?"

"Yes, but—"

"So eight more pieces over the next few months and you could apply for next fall."

I set the brochure down carefully, like it might explode. "This is really kind, but it's not realistic for someone like me."

"Why not?"

"Because..." I gesture vaguely. "Philadelphia. Art school. That's for people who have money and connections and—"

"Talent?" Chris interrupts gently. "Which you have. That's the whole point of scholarships, Annie. They're for talented people who need financial help."

I busy myself wiping down the already-clean counter. My heart is beating too fast, hope and fear tangled together in my chest.

Chris drinks his malt, watching me. "Will you at least keep the brochure? Read through it?"

I slide it into my apron pocket. "Okay."

His smile is worth the risk of hope.

On Wednesday, he brings information about Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore. Closer to home, he points out. Still excellent programs, but I could visit on weekends if I got homesick.

"I'm not getting homesick," I say. "Because I'm not going anywhere."

"Yet," Chris adds. "You're not going anywhere yet."

On Thursday, he shifts tactics entirely.

"If you could study anything," he asks, halfway through his cherry malt, "what would it be? Not illustration necessarily, but any kind of art. What calls to you?"

No one has ever asked me this. I think about it while serving Mrs. Henderson her vanilla malt, while Betty calls out an order for three root beer floats, while the jukebox plays "Put Your Head on My Shoulder."

When I return to Chris's section of counter, I have an answer.

"I like capturing people," I say quietly. "The way they sit, how they hold themselves, what their hands do when they're not thinking about it. I like finding the truth in ordinary moments. So probably illustration—magazine work, maybe, or book illustrations. Things that tell stories about real people."

Chris is looking at me with an expression I can't quite read. "That's specific. You've thought about this before."

"I've dreamed about it," I admit. "But there's a difference between dreaming and planning. Dreams are safe. They can't disappoint you if you never try to make them real."

"They also can't come true."

"Maybe some dreams aren't meant to."

"Or maybe some people are too scared to find out." He says it gently, without judgment. "Annie, you have a gift. Not a hobby, not a nice skill—an actual gift for seeing people and capturing something true about them. That's rare. And rare things should be developed, not hidden behind a malt shop counter forever."

"There's nothing wrong with working at a malt shop."

"There's nothing wrong with it," Chris agrees. "But there's also nothing wrong with wanting more. With being more."

The words hit somewhere deep. Wanting more. Being more. As if I'm allowed to take up space beyond what's been assigned to me.

On Friday, Chris brings a list of scholarship deadlines and portfolio requirements, neatly typed on his father's business stationery. He's done real research—contacted schools, requested information packets, mapped out application timelines.

"Most deadlines are in January or February," he explains, "which gives you six or seven months to build your portfolio. Completely doable."

I take the paper, studying his careful notes. He's thought about this more than I've let myself think about it in sixteen years.

"Why are you doing this?" The question comes out smaller than I intended.

Chris looks up from his malt. "Because someone should. Because you deserve to have someone believe in you enough to do the practical work of making dreams possible. And because..." He pauses. "Because I know what it's like to want something you're afraid to reach for. And I don't want you to live with that feeling forever."

Something shifts in my chest—a door opening, light spilling through.

That evening at home, I find my mother in the living room with her sewing basket. She's mending one of my father's work shirts, her needle moving in and out with practiced efficiency.

I sit down across from her, nervous.

"Mama?"

"Hmm?" She doesn't look up from her stitching.

"I was wondering..." I choose my words carefully. "What would you think about art school? Hypothetically."

Her needle pauses. "Art school?"

"For me. If I applied. There are programs in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Some offer scholarships."

Now she does look up, her expression unreadable. "Annie, where is this coming from?"

"I've been drawing more this summer. Keeping my work instead of throwing it away. And I thought maybe—"

"Art school costs money." She returns to her sewing, needle moving faster now. "Even with scholarships, there would be fees, supplies, living expenses. Your father and I don't have that kind of savings."

"I could work part-time. And if I got a good scholarship—"

"And what would you do with an art degree?" She cuts me off, not unkindly but firmly. "Where would it lead? What kind of job, what kind of future?"

"Illustration, maybe. Magazine work. Book covers. Commercial art."

"Maybe. Might. Possibly." My mother sets down the shirt, giving me her full attention now. "Annie, those are dreams. Not plans. Real work—steady work like your job at the malt shop—that's what girls from families like ours do. We don't gamble on maybes."

"But what if I'm good enough?"

Something flickers across her face—sadness, maybe, or recognition. "Being good enough isn't always enough. Life isn't fair that way." She picks up her sewing again. "You have a good job. Mr. Henderson values you. That's more than most girls your age can say. Be grateful for what you have instead of reaching for things that will only disappoint you."

The conversation is over. I can tell by the set of her shoulders, the finality in her tone.

"Yes, Mama."

I go to my room and close the door quietly. The art book Chris gave me sits on my nightstand, along with the brochures and scholarship information. I spread them across my bed, looking at the photographs of students in bright studios, teachers critiquing work, finished paintings displayed in galleries.

My mother's voice echoes in my head. *Girls from families like ours don't gamble on maybes.*

But Chris's voice is there too. *You have a gift. Rare things should be developed.*

I open the Philadelphia College of Art brochure and read every word. The illustration program requires fifteen portfolio pieces showing range and skill. Students take classes in figure drawing, color theory, composition, typography. Graduates work for magazines, publishing houses, advertising agencies.

There's a girl in one photograph who looks like she could be me—dark hair, serious expression, bent over her drawing board with complete focus. The caption reads: "Junior illustration major Sarah Chen working on editorial piece for Saturday Evening Post."

Saturday Evening Post. Real work. Professional work.

I let myself imagine it. Not just vaguely, the way I've always dreamed, but specifically. Sitting in that bright studio. Learning proper technique instead of fumbling through on my own. Having teachers who take my work seriously. Creating illustrations that people actually see, actually care about.

Making art that matters.

The wanting hits me so hard I have to press my hand against my chest. This isn't safe dreaming anymore, the kind that can't hurt you because it stays abstract. This is specific, concrete, almost touchable.

This is dangerous.

I stack the brochures carefully and tuck them into my drawer, beneath the art book. Then I pull out my sketchbook and draw from memory: the view of my mother sewing tonight, needle moving through fabric, expression distant and resigned. I try to capture what I saw in her face—that flicker of recognition when I asked about art school. Like she understood wanting something beyond your assigned role, but had learned long ago not to reach for it.

It's one of the best sketches I've ever done. I can see the years in her posture, the acceptance in the set of her mouth.

I label it carefully at the bottom: "Mother Sewing, July 1957."

Portfolio piece number eight.

Twelve more to go.

I don't know if I'll ever actually apply to art school. Don't know if I'm brave enough to try, strong enough to survive if I fail.

But for the first time in my life, I'm letting myself want it. Really want it. The kind of wanting that could break your heart if it doesn't work out.

And somehow, that feels like progress.

That feels like being alive instead of just existing.

I turn off my lamp and lie in darkness, thinking about Philadelphia. About studios full of light and work that matters and a future that's mine instead of assigned to me.

It's terrifying.

It's exhilarating.

It's a door Chris opened that I don't think I can close again, even if I wanted to.

And the scariest part?

I don't want to.
