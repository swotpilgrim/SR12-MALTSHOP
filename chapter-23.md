# Chapter 23: Chris's Search

Chris had only been gone for five minutes.

Five minutes talking to his mother about some business associate, making polite conversation about college. Five minutes of nodding while part of his attention stayed on where he'd left Annie by the punch table.

Five minutes, and when he finally headed back, she was gone.

He scanned the crowd for the pale blue dress. Annie had looked beautiful tonight—genuinely beautiful in a way that had nothing to do with the dress and everything to do with the girl herself.

But now he couldn't find her anywhere.

"Looking for someone?" Tommy appeared at his elbow with Jennifer.

"Have you seen Annie?"

Tommy shrugged. "Not recently. Maybe the powder room?"

Chris checked near the ladies' room, feeling foolish but too worried to care. Several women came and went, but no Annie. He circled the entire community center—dance floor, refreshment table, even outside on the steps.

Nothing.

A cold weight was settling in his stomach. Annie wouldn't just leave. Would she?

Except he thought about how uncomfortable she'd looked when he'd introduced her to Tommy's group. How she'd gone quiet after talking to Sandra. How she'd forced a smile and told him she was fine when he'd clearly seen something was wrong.

He'd left her alone in a room full of people she didn't know, people who—

Chris's jaw tightened. What had Sandra said to her? Or Tommy's girlfriend Jennifer, who could be sweet but also had a cutting edge when she felt like using it?

"Chris?" His mother appeared, her society smile in place. "There you are. The Mitchells wanted to say hello, and I thought—"

"I'm sorry, Mom, I can't right now. I need to find Annie."

His mother's smile faltered. "Your date? I'm sure she's around somewhere, dear. Don't worry so much."

But he was worried. Annie had been terrified to come tonight, had almost said no entirely. He'd promised her they'd have a good time, that she'd fit in fine because she'd be with him.

And then he'd left her alone.

"Excuse me," he said to his mother, already moving toward the exit. He had to find her.

The cool night air hit him as he pushed through the doors. Maybe Annie had just needed air. Maybe she was walking around the building.

He circled the community center twice, calling her name softly. Nothing.

His concern shifted to real worry. Where would she go?

Chris thought about their summer afternoons at the malt shop. How Annie relaxed behind the counter where she felt competent and safe. How she'd said once that the malt shop was the only place she felt like she knew who she was supposed to be.

The malt shop.

Of course. If Annie had run—and he was certain she had—she would have gone to her sanctuary.

Chris walked quickly down Main Street, his dress shoes clicking against sidewalk. The shops were dark, the boardwalk quiet.

His mind raced. What had happened? He replayed the evening from Annie's perspective. She'd been nervous when they arrived—he'd felt her hand trembling. He'd tried to stay close, to show her she belonged.

But then Tommy had pulled him away. Maybe two minutes, he'd thought. Just a quick hello.

Except it had been longer, and he'd left Annie alone in a room full of people who probably...

Oh God.

Sandra had been nearby when he'd walked away. Sandra, who could be territorial in ways she thought were subtle. Who'd made comments before about girls who weren't "quite right" for their circle.

What had she said to Annie?

And Jennifer—he'd heard her make catty remarks at other events, dismissing people she thought didn't belong.

The cold weight in Chris's stomach turned to anger. Not at Annie, but at himself. For not seeing that leaving her alone was like throwing her to the wolves. For not realizing his world could be cruel to people it deemed outsiders.

He'd promised her a good time.

And instead, someone had hurt her badly enough that she'd run.

The Seabreeze Malt Shop came into view, and Chris's heart jumped when he saw dim lights on inside. She was there. Thank God, she was there.

He crossed the street quickly and approached the glass door, peering inside. The shop was mostly dark, just moonlight streaming through the windows, but he could make out a figure sitting at the counter.

Annie.

Relief flooded through him so intensely his knees almost buckled.

She was hunched over on one of the red vinyl stools, still in her blue dress, and even from outside he could see her shoulders shaking. She was crying.

The relief transformed back into fury—not at her, but at whoever had done this. At Sandra and Jennifer and everyone else who thought being born into the right family gave them the right to make someone else feel small.

At himself, for not protecting her from it.

Chris raised his hand and knocked on the door, trying to be gentle even though every instinct was screaming at him to break the lock if necessary and get to her.

Annie's head jerked up. Through the glass, their eyes met.

He saw the tear tracks on her face, the smudged makeup, the devastation written across her features. She looked at him like she was seeing a stranger, like the boy who'd picked her up tonight with promises of a wonderful evening had turned into someone she didn't trust.

And that hurt more than anything.

He knocked again, mouthing her name, willing her to let him in. Willing her to let him explain, to listen, to understand that whatever had happened at that dance wasn't what he wanted.

For a horrible moment, he thought she might turn away. Might leave him standing outside while she hid in the sanctuary of her malt shop, shutting him out from both the physical space and whatever was going on in her head.

But then she stood. Walked toward the door on shaky legs.

The lock clicked.

The moment she opened the door, Chris stepped inside, and the words tumbled out.

"Annie, God, when I turned around and you were gone—I looked everywhere. I thought maybe you went outside for air, but then you weren't anywhere and I—"

He stopped, really seeing her face in the dim light. The evidence of her tears. The pain she wasn't even trying to hide anymore.

"What happened?" The question came out rough with emotion.

She opened her mouth but no sound came. Chris felt his hands clenching into fists at his sides. If Sandra had said something cruel, if Jennifer had made one of her cutting remarks, if anyone at that dance had made Annie feel like she didn't belong—

"Did someone say something to you?" He heard his voice getting harder. "Sandra? Tommy? Because I swear if anyone—"

"It doesn't matter." Annie's voice was flat, defeated in a way he'd never heard before. "They didn't say anything that wasn't true."

"What are you talking about?"

And then she said it—the words that made his heart sink. That she didn't belong in his world. That everyone had seen her for what she really was: the help, given a night out as an act of charity.

Charity.

Chris felt like he'd been punched in the stomach.

"Is that what you think this is? Charity?"

"Isn't it?" She looked at him with those devastated eyes. "Be honest, Chris. You're the boy who includes the kids others ignore. Who's kind to everyone. Who has such a generous spirit." She threw the words at him like accusations. "That's what this summer was, wasn't it? You being kind to the invisible girl?"

"No." The word burst out of him, fierce and angry. Not angry at her—angry at everyone who'd made her believe this lie about herself, about him, about what they had. "No, Annie, that's not—that's not even close to what this is."

"Then what is it?" Her voice cracked. "Because from where I'm standing, it looks like you took pity on me. Gave me some attention, made me feel special, and tonight your whole world reminded me exactly why that was never going to work."

Chris stared at her, standing there in her blue dress in the middle of the empty malt shop, and felt something shift inside him. He'd been careful all summer. Careful not to push too hard, to let Annie set the pace, to respect her fears even when he didn't fully understand them.

But careful wasn't working anymore. Careful had let her believe a lie about his feelings.

It was time to stop being careful and start being honest.

Even if it scared them both.

"You want to know what this is?" He took a step closer, his voice low and intense. "This is me, falling for a girl who makes the best cherry malts in Seabreeze and draws beautiful sketches on napkins and notices things about people that no one else sees. This is me spending every afternoon at this counter because talking to you is the best part of my day. This is me asking you to that dance not because I felt sorry for you, but because I wanted to be there with you. Because you're the only person in this whole town who sees me—really sees me—not just as some hardware store heir or college boy or whatever label everyone else wants to put on me."

Annie was staring at him now, tears still on her cheeks but something else entering her expression. Confusion. Hope. Fear.

"I don't care what Sandra Mitchell thinks," Chris continued, the words pouring out now. "I don't care what Tommy's girlfriend says or what anyone at that stupid dance believes about us. The only thing I care about is you. And whether you're going to let other people's judgments destroy something real before it even has a chance to become what it could be."

He stopped, breathing hard, and waited.

Waited for Annie to tell him he was wrong, that it wasn't enough, that the distance between their worlds was too big to cross.

Or waited for her to finally, finally believe him.
