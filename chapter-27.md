# Chapter 27: Dancing in the Dark

After Chris's declaration, the malt shop fell into a silence that felt both heavy and sacred.

I didn't know how to respond to what he'd just said. No one had ever chosen me so deliberately, so publicly, with such full knowledge of the social cost. Chris had just laid out everything he felt, everything he wanted, and now he was waiting for me to do the same.

To choose him back.

Or to let fear win.

I opened my mouth, but the words stuck in my throat. How could I possibly articulate what I was feeling? The terror mixed with hope, the disbelief mixed with desperate wanting, the voice in my head that still insisted this couldn't be real warring with the part of me that was starting to believe it might be?

Chris must have seen my struggle, because he stepped back slightly, giving me space to breathe.

"I don't need an answer right now," he said gently. "Tonight was a lot. What Sandra said, what you overheard—that was cruel and unfair and I'm sorry you had to experience it. If you need time to think, I understand."

But I'd been thinking for weeks. Months, maybe. I'd been thinking since the first day Chris walked into the malt shop and ordered a cherry malt, since the first time he'd looked at me like I was someone worth seeing. I'd thought myself in circles, built walls of logic and reason and fear to protect myself from hoping for something impossible.

And where had all that thinking gotten me?

Here. Standing in an empty malt shop in a ruined dress with tear-stained cheeks, having run away from the one thing I actually wanted because I'd been too afraid to reach for it.

Maybe it was time to stop thinking and start feeling.

"Dance with me," I heard myself say.

Chris blinked, surprised. "What?"

"Dance with me. Here. Now." The words were coming faster now, fueled by a surge of something I couldn't quite name. Not quite courage, not quite desperation. Maybe some combination of both. "We never got to really dance at the Summer Social. I was too nervous, too aware of everyone watching. But here there's no one watching. Just us."

A slow smile spread across Chris's face. "I don't think the jukebox is on."

"So turn it on."

He held my gaze for a long moment, something shifting in his expression—surprise giving way to understanding, understanding giving way to joy. Then he crossed to the jukebox in three long strides.

I watched as he dug a nickel from his pocket, the same pocket that probably still held his car keys and his wallet and all the trappings of the life he'd temporarily left behind to come find me. He fed the nickel into the slot with the practiced ease of someone who'd done this dozens of times before.

The machine whirred to life, lights flickering on, painting the dark malt shop in soft jewel tones—red and blue and gold.

Chris's finger hovered over the selection buttons for just a moment before he pressed B-7.

"Earth Angel" by The Penguins.

Of course. Our song. The first one he'd ever played for me, back when this whole thing had started and I'd still been convinced it was just friendly conversation between a customer and the girl behind the counter.

The opening notes filled the malt shop, that distinctive doo-wop sound that always made my chest feel tight. But tonight it felt different. Tonight it wasn't background music for an afternoon shift. Tonight it was ours.

Chris walked back to me, the colored lights from the jukebox catching in his dark hair, making him look almost unreal. Like something from a dream.

He held out his hand. "May I have this dance?"

I looked down at myself—the blue dress that had seemed so perfect a few hours ago now wrinkled and tear-stained, Diane's borrowed pearls I'd set aside on the counter, my carefully styled hair falling loose from its pins. I was a mess. The exact opposite of the poised, elegant girls who'd been dancing at the community center.

But Chris wasn't looking at me like I was a mess. He was looking at me like I was exactly what he wanted.

So I put my hand in his.

His fingers closed around mine, warm and solid and real, and he pulled me close. Not the careful, proper distance we'd maintained on the dance floor at the Summer Social, but really close—his other hand settling on the small of my back, my free hand resting on his shoulder, our bodies nearly touching.

This was nothing like the dancing we'd attempted at the community center.

There, I'd been so tense, so aware of my feet and the rhythm and the watching eyes. I'd stumbled and fumbled and felt like a fraud.

But here, with just the two of us and the music and the familiar space of the malt shop wrapping around us like a cocoon, I let myself relax into Chris's lead. Let him guide me in small circles between the chrome stools and the red vinyl booths, our feet moving slowly across the black and white checkered floor.

"See?" Chris murmured, his breath warm against my temple. "You can dance just fine."

"Or you're just good at making me feel like I can."

"Maybe both things are true."

We swayed in silence for a moment, the Penguins crooning about earth angels and heavenly kisses. I'd heard this song a hundred times on the jukebox, but I'd never really listened to the words before. Never let myself think about what it might mean to be someone's earth angel, someone's dream come true.

"I was so scared tonight," I admitted softly. "At the dance. I felt like everyone could see right through me, could see that I didn't belong there."

"You're right," Chris said, and I tensed until he continued. "You didn't belong there. Not because you're not good enough for that world, but because that world isn't good enough for you."

I pulled back slightly so I could see his face. "That's not what I meant."

"I know. But it's what I mean." His eyes were serious now, intense in the colored light. "Annie, those people at the dance—they're playing a game with rules that don't actually matter. Who has the right last name, who wears the right clothes, who knows the right people. It's all performance. All surface."

"But it's your world," I protested. "You grew up in it. You belong to it."

"I was born into it," Chris corrected. "That's not the same as belonging. You can be surrounded by people your whole life and still feel completely alone. Still feel like you're performing a part instead of living an authentic life."

The song shifted to the bridge, the harmonies swelling around us.

"But with you," he continued, "I don't feel alone. I don't feel like I'm performing. I feel like myself. Like the version of me I actually want to be, not the version everyone expects."

My throat was tight again, emotion welling up. "What if I can't be brave enough for this? What if I keep running every time it gets scary?"

"Then I'll keep coming to find you." Chris pulled me closer, until my cheek was resting against his chest and I could hear his heartbeat beneath his shirt. Steady. Reliable. Real. "I'll keep playing 'Earth Angel' on the jukebox until you believe me. I'll keep showing up at three o'clock every afternoon. I'll keep choosing you until you feel brave enough to choose yourself."

We moved in slow circles, the malt shop spinning gently around us. The chrome counter where we'd spent so many afternoons talking. The red vinyl stools where he'd sat day after day, ordering cherry malts and looking at me like I mattered. The jukebox that had become the soundtrack to our summer.

This space had been my sanctuary, my safe place, the one corner of the world where I felt competent and valuable. And now Chris was here too, making it ours instead of just mine.

"Thank you," I whispered.

"For what?"

"For coming to find me. For not being embarrassed that I ran away. For..." I struggled to find the words. "For seeing me. Really seeing me. Even the scared parts."

"Especially the scared parts," Chris corrected gently. "The scared parts are honest. They're real. They're you trying to protect yourself because you've been hurt before, because the world has told you that you don't deserve beautiful things. And I want to prove the world wrong."

The song was starting to wind down now, the final verse approaching. Soon it would end and we'd have to decide what came next. Go back to the dance? Go home? Face all the questions and consequences of tonight?

But for now, we just danced.

I lifted my head from his chest and looked up at him. In the jukebox light, his face was half in shadow, half illuminated in warm gold. He was beautiful—not in the polished, practiced way of the boys at the Summer Social, but in a way that was real and present and here.

"I want to try," I said, the words coming out stronger than I expected. "I want to be brave enough to try this. Us. Even though it scares me. Even though I don't know how it's going to work. Even though—"

Chris stopped moving, stopped dancing, and just looked at me. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." I nodded, feeling the certainty settle into my bones. "I choose this. I choose you. I choose us."

The smile that broke across his face was like sunrise—slow and inevitable and absolutely radiant.

"Earth Angel" played its final notes, the harmonies fading into silence. But Chris didn't let me go. And I didn't step away.

We just stood there in the middle of the empty malt shop, holding each other, choosing each other, being brave enough to believe that maybe—just maybe—we were both worth fighting for.

The jukebox went quiet, its colored lights still glowing softly in the darkness.

And for the first time all night, I felt like I was exactly where I belonged.
