# Chapter 16: The Invitation

I knew something was different the moment Chris walked through the door.

It was three weeks into what Betty had started calling "the cherry malt romance," though I'd shushed her every time she said it where customers could hear. Three o'clock had become my favorite hour of the day, the moment when Chris Donovan would push through the malt shop door and everything would feel a little brighter, a little more possible.

But today, his usual easy confidence seemed frayed around the edges.

"The usual?" I asked, already reaching for a glass, my hands knowing the routine by heart now.

"Yeah. Cherry malt. Thanks, Annie." He settled onto his regular stool, but his fingers drummed against the chrome counter edge. Once. Twice. Three times.

I mixed his malt with the precision I'd perfected over the summer, the right ratio of vanilla ice cream to milk, the careful measure of cherry syrup that made it sweet without being cloying. Usually, I'd hear him commenting on the weather or asking about my day while I worked. Today, silence stretched between us like taffy, sticky and strange.

When I set the glass in front of him, he stared at it like he'd forgotten what it was for.

"Chris?" I wiped my hands on my pink apron. "Is something wrong?"

"No. No, everything's fine." He wrapped both hands around the cold glass but didn't lift it. "Actually, I—" He stopped, cleared his throat. "How's your day been?"

"About the same as usual. Mrs. Henderson came in for her Tuesday sundae. Mr. Jenkins complained about the tourists taking all the good parking spots." I studied his face, trying to read what had him so rattled. "Are you sure you're okay?"

Betty chose that moment to breeze past with a tray of dirty dishes, her eyes flickering between us with barely suppressed curiosity. I could practically hear her storing up questions for later.

Chris took a breath, the kind you take before diving into cold water. "Annie, I wanted to ask you something."

My heart started beating faster. I told myself it was nothing, that he probably just wanted to know if we carried a different flavor of syrup or if Mr. Henderson had gotten those new comic books he'd mentioned. But the way he was looking at me—nervous and hopeful and determined all at once—made my mouth go dry.

"Okay," I managed.

"There's this dance coming up. The Seabreeze Summer Social. It's next Saturday, at the community center." He was talking faster now, words tumbling over each other. "There's a live band, and decorations, and it's kind of the biggest thing Seabreeze does all summer. Everyone goes—well, all the families and  the summer crowd and—" He stopped himself. "I'm making this sound like a big deal."

"Isn't it?" My voice came out smaller than I intended.

"I guess it is. Kind of." He met my eyes finally, and I saw something vulnerable there beneath his nervousness. "I was wondering if you'd like to go. With me. To the dance."

The world seemed to tilt sideways.

The Seabreeze Summer Social. I'd heard about it my whole life, seen the decorations go up in the community center, watched from the malt shop window as people in their best clothes arrived in shiny cars. It was where Mayor Mitchell gave his annual summer address, where the Yacht Club ladies wore their pearls, where boys in suits asked girls in formal dresses to dance under twinkling lights.

It wasn't for girls like me.

"I can't," I blurted out before I could stop myself.

Chris's face fell, just for a second, before he schooled it back into something more neutral. "Oh. Okay. I just thought—"

"I don't have a dress." The words were tumbling out now, excuses piling on top of each other. "And I'd have to ask my parents, and I'm not sure I'd even fit in at something like that, and I might have to work that evening—"

"Annie." He said my name gently, and I stopped babbling. "Those all sound like problems we could solve. If you wanted to go."

Did I want to go? The question lodged somewhere between my racing heart and my panicked thoughts. Of course I wanted to go. The idea of dancing with Chris, of wearing something pretty and feeling his hand in mine while music played—it was like something from a dream. But dreams had a way of turning into nightmares when you were foolish enough to believe in them.

"I don't know," I said honestly.

"Is it because you don't want to go with me?" His voice was quiet, careful. "Because if that's it, that's okay. I just—I'd like to take you. If you're interested."

"It's not that." I twisted my dishrag between my hands, wishing I could explain the knot of fear in my stomach. "It's just... the Summer Social. That's not really for people like me."

"People like you?" He frowned. "What does that mean?"

How could I explain that girls like Sandra Mitchell went to events like the Summer Social—girls with closets full of dresses and mothers who knew which fork to use at fancy dinners? Girls who moved through those spaces like they owned them, because in a way, they did. I was the girl behind the counter, the one who served the sodas and cleared the glasses and went home smelling like vanilla syrup.

"I just don't think I'd fit in," I said finally.

"You'd fit in fine." There was certainty in his voice that I didn't feel. "You'd be with me."

That was exactly what scared me. Being with him, in public, where everyone could see. Where they'd wonder what a college boy from a good family was doing with the quiet malt shop girl. Where I'd inevitably do something wrong, use the wrong word or wear the wrong thing or stand the wrong way, and prove to everyone—including Chris—that I didn't belong.

"I need to think about it," I said.

Chris nodded slowly. "Okay. That's fair." He pulled a napkin toward him and fished a pen from his pocket, writing something quickly. "This is my number. In case you decide yes. Or if you want to talk about it. Or anything."

He slid the napkin across the counter. His handwriting was neat, precise. I stared at those numbers like they were a code I couldn't quite crack.

"I really would like you to come, Annie." His voice was soft but earnest. "I think we'd have a good time."

Before I could respond, the door jangled and a family of four bustled in, the children immediately clamoring to see the ice cream flavors. Chris glanced at them, then back at me.

"I should let you work." He finally picked up his cherry malt, took a long drink. "Think about it?"

"I will," I promised, though I already knew my answer would be no. It had to be no. It was the only safe answer.

He left a five-dollar bill for a drink that cost seventy-five cents, waved off my protest about the change, and headed for the door. I watched him go, the napkin with his phone number still on the counter between us like a dare I wasn't brave enough to accept.

The moment the door swung shut, Betty was at my side.

"Did Chris Donovan just ask you to the Summer Social?" Her voice was pitched high with excitement.

"Yes," I admitted.

"And?"

"And I'm going to tell him no."

"Annie Palmer!" Betty grabbed my shoulders and spun me to face her. "Are you out of your mind? The most gorgeous boy in Seabreeze just asked you to the biggest dance of the summer and you're going to say no?"

"I don't have a dress, Betty. And even if I did—"

"We'll find you a dress. Mrs. Chen's secondhand store, the church donation shop, my cousin Maria has about a million dresses from when she was in high school. That's not a real reason and you know it."

Ruth had drifted over, her young face bright with romantic interest. "What's happening?"

"Chris asked Annie to the Summer Social and she's going to say no like a complete ninny," Betty announced.

"You can't say no!" Ruth looked scandalized. "That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard!"

"It's not romantic, it's terrifying." I picked up the napkin, stared at those numbers again. "The Summer Social isn't for people like me. Everyone will be there—Mayor Mitchell, the Hendersons, all the families with their summer homes and their memberships at the Yacht Club. They'll take one look at me and know I don't belong."

"So what?" Betty's hands were on her hips now, her dark eyes flashing. "You belong anywhere Chris Donovan invites you to be. He asked you, Annie. Not Sandra Mitchell, not any of those other girls who've been making eyes at him all summer. You."

"That's what doesn't make sense," I said quietly. "Why would he ask me?"

Betty's expression softened. "Oh, honey. Because he likes you. Anyone with eyes can see that."

"He likes talking to me here," I gestured around the malt shop. "This is safe. This is easy. But taking me to the Summer Social? That's different. That's putting me in front of everyone and asking them to accept that we're... that we're..." I couldn't even finish the sentence.

"Together?" Ruth supplied helpfully. "A couple? Going steady?"

The words made my cheeks burn. Were we any of those things? Or were we just a boy and a girl who talked over cherry malts, whose connection existed only in the comfortable anonymity of the malt shop?

"Just think about it," Betty urged. "Don't decide right now. Sleep on it."

But I didn't need to sleep on it. I knew what the answer had to be. Going to the Summer Social would mean stepping out of the safe space we'd created here, would mean exposing myself to judgment and comparison and inevitable disappointment. It would mean watching Chris realize, in front of all his friends and family, that I wasn't the kind of girl you took to important events.

Better to keep things as they were. Better to stay behind the counter where I belonged.

I folded the napkin with his number and tucked it into my apron pocket, telling myself I'd throw it away later. I didn't need it. I already knew what I was going to say.

No.

It was the only answer that made sense. The only one that wouldn't end in humiliation and heartbreak.

Even if some small, foolish part of me desperately wished I could say yes.
