# Chapter 14: Growing Confidence

The changes happen so gradually I almost don't notice them. But Betty does.

"You're different," she announces one morning while we're setting up before opening. She's arranging straws in their dispenser, watching me out of the corner of her eye.

"Different how?" I'm checking the ice cream freezer temperatures, same as I do every morning.

"I don't know exactly. More..." She searches for the word. "Present? Like you're actually here instead of hiding behind the counter."

"I've always been here. Literally. Every day."

"You know what I mean." Betty closes the straw dispenser with a decisive click. "You're standing differently. Speaking up more. Yesterday you suggested that new sundae combination to Mr. Henderson."

"The cherry-chocolate swirl with crushed graham crackers? That was just an idea."

"An idea you would have kept to yourself two months ago. But yesterday you actually proposed it, and Mr. Henderson's putting it on the special board this week." She grins. "The 'Annie's Summer Special.'"

My face heats up. "He's not calling it that."

"He absolutely is. I saw him writing the sign this morning."

She's right. When Mr. Henderson arrives and pins the new special board near the register, there it is in his careful handwriting: "Annie's Summer Special - Cherry-Chocolate Swirl Sundae with Graham Cracker Crumble."

"Good work, Annie," he says, nodding at the board. "Sometimes the best ideas come from the people actually making the food."

It's a small thing. Just a sundae. But seeing my name on that board, acknowledging that my idea was worth trying, makes something shift inside me.

That evening at home, I study my reflection in the bathroom mirror. Betty was right about me standing differently—my shoulders are back instead of rounded forward, my chin level instead of ducked down. When did that happen?

I've been wearing my hair in the same simple ponytail since I was thirteen, but suddenly it feels wrong. Too safe. Too much like hiding.

I take it down and try pinning it up the way I saw in a magazine at the drugstore—soft waves around my face, the back secured with pins. It takes three tries to get it right, but when I'm done, I look... different. Older, maybe. More deliberate.

"That's pretty," my mother says when I come down for dinner. She sounds surprised.

I almost change it back. Almost retreats to familiar ponytail territory. But then I think about Chris saying I'm braver than I realize, and I leave it.

The next day, Betty squeals when she sees me. "Look at you! Annie Palmer with actual style!"

"It's just hair."

"It's never just hair." She circles me like I'm a science experiment. "This is good. This is really good. What's next, actual lipstick?"

"Let's not get crazy."

But two days later, I do borrow Betty's light pink lipstick. Just a subtle wash of color, nothing dramatic. Chris notices immediately when he arrives at three.

"Something's different," he says, studying my face.

"Is it bad?"

"No. Just different. Good different." He smiles. "You look nice, Annie."

The compliment makes me duck my head, but I catch myself and meet his eyes instead. "Thank you."

Small things. Hair and lipstick and standing straighter. But they accumulate.

The following Tuesday, I'm sketching during a slow afternoon—my notebook open right on the counter, not hidden in my apron or under the register like I used to do. I'm drawing the view through the front window: Ocean Avenue with its summer tourists, the parking meters standing at attention, the drugstore across the street with its striped awning.

"Whatcha drawing?"

I look up to find Mrs. Henderson standing at the counter, her vanilla malt forgotten.

My first instinct is to close the notebook, hide it away, make excuses. But I force myself to turn it so she can see.

"Just the street view. Nothing special."

Mrs. Henderson adjusts her glasses and leans closer. "Oh my. Annie, that's wonderful. Look at the detail on that awning—you can practically read the lettering."

"It's just a sketch."

"It's more than that." She looks at me over her glasses. "You have a real gift, dear. Are you taking art classes?"

"Not yet. Maybe someday."

"Well, you should. Talent like that needs nurturing." She picks up her malt. "My sister went to art school in Philadelphia back in the thirties. Best decision she ever made. She does illustration work for magazines now."

After she leaves, I sit with that information. Real person. Real path. Real possibility.

Two days later, a tourist asks what I'm drawing. I show him—a quick study of the jukebox with its glowing colors. He's impressed, asks if I do commissions. I say no, too flustered to think clearly, but later I wonder: Could I? Could people actually pay for my work?

Each time someone asks to see what I'm drawing, it gets slightly easier. The panic lessens. The automatic impulse to hide weakens.

I'm still not confident. But I'm less terrified.

Wednesday brings a difficult customer—Mr. Pritchard, who comes in occasionally and treats service workers like they're invisible until he needs something, then expects miracles.

He snaps his fingers at me. "Girl. This chocolate malt is too thick. Make another one."

The old Annie would have apologized immediately, taken the malt, made a new one without question. Would have absorbed his rudeness as deserved somehow.

But I look at the malt—it's perfect consistency, exactly how chocolate malts should be—and something in me refuses.

"That's our standard consistency for malts, sir," I say calmly. "But I can thin it slightly with a bit more milk if you prefer."

Mr. Pritchard blinks, not expecting pushback. "I said make a new one."

"I can adjust this one in about thirty seconds." I keep my voice level, polite but firm. "That way you won't have to wait for a completely new malt."

He stares at me for a long moment, then huffs. "Fine. Thin it then."

I add a splash of milk, blend for five seconds, and hand it back. "How's this?"

He takes a drink, nods grudgingly. "Better."

It's not better. It's exactly the same except slightly thinner. But it's what he wanted, and I didn't let him bulldoze me into unnecessary work.

When he leaves, Betty appears at my elbow. "Did you just stand up to Mr. Pritchard?"

"I just... didn't let him be unreasonable."

"Annie Palmer." Betty looks at me with something like awe. "Who are you and what have you done with my pushover best friend?"

"I'm not a pushover."

"You were." She says it gently. "But you're not anymore. Or not as much, anyway."

That afternoon, Ruth approaches hesitantly during a lull. "Annie? Can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"There's this customer who comes in sometimes—older lady, always complains about something. Yesterday she said my milkshake was poorly made and demanded I remake it twice. I don't know how to handle people like that."

The old Annie would have deflected—told Ruth to ask Betty or Mr. Henderson, anyone with more authority or confidence.

But instead, I think about my interaction with Mr. Pritchard.

"Some people complain because something's actually wrong," I say slowly. "But some people complain because it makes them feel important. The trick is figuring out which is which."

"How do you tell?"

"If they're specific about what's wrong, it's usually real. But if they're vague or keep changing complaints, they just want attention." I wipe down the counter. "For those customers, I stay polite but firm. I offer to fix actual problems, but I don't apologize for doing my job correctly."

Ruth nods, considering this. "That makes sense. Thanks, Annie."

After she walks away, I realize I just gave advice. Actually helpful advice that someone asked for and valued.

When did that become something I could do?

That evening at home, my mother makes a comment about my hair while we're doing dishes.

"Are you trying to look like one of those magazine girls?" There's disapproval in her tone. "Simple is better for girls with your face shape."

The old Annie would have nodded, taken it down, gone back to invisible ponytails.

But I meet her eyes in the reflection of the window above the sink. "I like my hair this way."

My mother pauses mid-dish. "What?"

"This style. I like it." My voice is calm but certain. "It feels more like me."

She stares at me for a long moment, clearly not expecting pushback. Then she returns to washing. "Well. It's your hair, I suppose."

That's it. No argument, no insistence. Just acceptance.

It's such a small moment. Just hair, just one gentle pushback. But standing there with my hands in dishwater, I realize I just advocated for myself with my mother.

And the world didn't end.

That night, I lie in bed thinking about all these small changes. The sundae on the special board. The hair I keep styled differently. The way I'm sketching openly instead of hiding. Standing up to difficult customers. Giving advice when asked. Pushing back gently when my mother criticizes.

None of these things are dramatic. I haven't transformed into someone else. I'm still Annie Palmer, still working at the malt shop, still uncertain about most things.

But I'm not making myself smaller anymore.

I've spent so long trying to be invisible—head down, voice quiet, taking up as little space as possible. Believing that invisible meant safe, that being overlooked meant being protected from disappointment or judgment.

But I've been in a shell without fully realizing it. Making myself less than necessary because I thought that's what being good meant.

Chris's attention didn't magically fix my insecurity. His belief in me didn't suddenly make me confident.

But it gave me permission. Permission to believe I might be someone worth noticing. Worth listening to. Worth taking up space.

And that permission has been gradually giving me courage. To try new things. To speak up. To push back when pushed. To stop apologizing for existing.

I'm still scared most of the time. Still uncertain. Still Annie.

But I'm becoming a version of Annie who's less afraid to be seen.

Who's starting to believe that being visible doesn't have to mean being vulnerable.

That maybe, just maybe, I deserve to take up space in the world.

And that feels like progress.

That feels like becoming someone I might actually like.
