# Chapter 7: The Book

Friday afternoon arrives with sunshine that makes everything feel possible. The shop is moderately busy—steady enough to keep me occupied, which is good. If I have too much time to think, I'll spend it anxiously watching the clock.

Three o'clock approaches with its usual gravitational pull.

I'm refilling napkin dispensers when Ruth sidles up beside me.

"So," she says quietly. "Is today the day you tell him you like him?"

I nearly drop the napkins. "What? No."

"Betty told me you admitted it yesterday. She says he definitely likes you back. So are you going to say something?"

"Absolutely not."

"But why not?"

"Because what if Betty's wrong? What if I make it weird?"

"What if she's right and you never find out because you're too scared?"

When did Ruth get so bold?

"I'm not scared," I lie.

Ruth gives me a look that says she sees right through me, but drops the subject when a customer approaches.

At three o'clock, Chris walks through the door, and my heart does its familiar leap.

But today he's carrying something—a book. A paperback with a worn cover, held carefully like it matters.

"Hi, Annie." He sits at his usual stool, setting the book on the counter.

"Hi." I'm reaching for a glass, but my eyes keep darting to the book. "Cherry malt?"

"Please. But first—" He slides the book toward me. "I brought you something."

I freeze. "What?"

"It's a book. About American art. Paintings and sketches." He seems nervous. "My English professor recommended it. I noticed you doodling on a napkin, and I thought maybe you'd like it."

I stare at the book. No one has ever given me a book before. Especially not one related to art—to the thing I do in secret.

"I..." Words fail me.

"If you don't want it, that's okay," Chris says quickly. "I just thought—there's this one artist who does incredible sketches of ordinary moments, and I thought of you."

He thought of me. When he wasn't here, he was thinking about me.

"You didn't have to do this," I manage.

"I know. I wanted to." He's watching my face. "Is it weird?"

"No." I touch the book, running my fingers over the cover. It's clearly used—spine creased, pages yellowed. Not expensive, but thoughtful. So thoughtful it makes my chest ache. "It's really nice. Thank you."

His smile is worth every second of my awkwardness. "I hope you like it."

I set the book aside and make Chris's cherry malt with shaking hands. This is more than friendly conversation. This is a gift that shows he's been paying attention, that he cares.

When I set the malt in front of him, he leans forward.

"Can I ask you something?"

My heart rate picks up. "Sure."

"The book has this section on illustration—commercial art, magazine illustrations. I was wondering... is that something you'd be interested in? As a career?"

No one has ever asked me about art as a potential career.

"I don't know," I say honestly. "I've never thought about it as something I could actually do."

"Why not?"

"Because people like me don't become artists. That's for people who go to fancy schools and have connections."

"People like you?" Chris's voice is gentle. "What does that mean?"

"People who make malts in small-town shops." I gesture at my apron, at the counter. "This is what people like me do. Practical jobs."

"But you're talented."

"You've seen one napkin sketch."

"So show me more." He says it like it's simple. "I bet you're better than you think."

I want to argue. But something stops me. Maybe it's the book, proof that someone thinks I'm worth investing in. Maybe it's the way Chris is looking at me, like my dreams matter.

"Maybe," I say quietly. The smallest possible opening.

Chris smiles. "Maybe is good. Maybe is a start."

Betty passes with dirty dishes and catches my eye, raising her eyebrows at the book.

"How was your morning at the hardware store?" I ask, changing the subject.

"Oh, fascinating as always." Chris launches into a story about a customer returning a fifteen-year-old hammer, and I'm grateful for lighter territory.

But throughout our conversation, I'm hyperaware of the book. Every glance at it makes something flutter in my chest—hope, maybe, or possibility.

When Chris finishes his malt and pulls out his wallet, I find my courage.

"Thank you," I say. "For the book. Really. It's... no one's ever given me anything like that before."

"Then people haven't been paying attention." He says it so simply, like it's fact rather than opinion. "I'm glad you like it."

"I do. A lot."

"Good." He stands, pushing his stool in with that careful courtesy I've come to expect. "Will you tell me what you think? About the book, I mean. After you look through it?"

"You're going to come back?" I immediately regret asking—of course he's coming back, he comes back every day.

But Chris doesn't seem to think it's a stupid question. "Annie, I'm going to keep coming back as long as you keep making perfect cherry malts and putting up with my hardware store stories. Is that okay?"

The way he asks it, like my opinion matters, like I have any say in whether he keeps showing up—it does something to me.

"That's okay," I manage.

"See you Monday, then."

Monday. Not tomorrow, because the shop is closed on Saturdays and Sundays. Two whole days without seeing him. The thought sits uncomfortable in my chest.

"See you Monday."

He waves and leaves, and I'm left standing at the counter with an empty glass and a book that feels like it weighs a thousand pounds.

Betty appears the instant the door closes. "Oh my God."

"Don't start."

"Don't start? Annie, he brought you a book! About art! Because he remembered you talking about art and he wanted to encourage your talent! That boy is—"

"I know." I cut her off because if she finishes that sentence, if she says out loud what I'm barely letting myself think, it might shatter like glass. "I know, okay? I know."

Betty studies my face, then her expression softens. "You're scared."

"Terrified."

"Of what?"

"Of..." I gesture helplessly. "Of this being real. Of letting myself believe he actually likes me and then finding out I was wrong. Of wanting something this much and losing it."

"Oh, honey." Betty's voice is gentle. "That's what hope feels like. It's always scary. But you know what's scarier? Never finding out. Spending your whole life wondering 'what if.'"

I look down at the book, at its worn cover and creased spine. Chris carried this around with him. He thought about me when I wasn't there. He cared enough to want to nurture something in me that I barely let myself acknowledge.

"What do I do?" I ask quietly.

"You read the book. You let yourself enjoy it. You tell him what you think on Monday, and you let yourself have a real conversation about something you care about. And maybe, just maybe, you start believing that you deserve this."

That last part is the hardest. Believing I deserve anything beyond what I have.

But that night, in my tiny bedroom with the window open and the sound of distant waves filling the air, I open the book Chris gave me.

The first section is paintings—landscapes and portraits, dramatic and beautiful. But it's the second section that makes my breath catch. Sketches. Line drawings of ordinary moments. A woman on a subway platform. A man reading a newspaper. Children playing in a street.

Simple moments, captured simply. But there's something in the lines, in the way the artist caught the curve of a shoulder or the tilt of a head, that makes them extraordinary.

I find myself studying each sketch, seeing how the artist built form with just a few lines, how shadow was suggested rather than drawn, how personality emerged from minimal detail.

These aren't complicated. They're not grand or impressive or trying to be more than they are.

They're just... true.

I think about my napkin sketches, the ones I always throw away. The way I try to capture Betty mid-laugh or Mr. Henderson counting the register or the exact angle of afternoon light through the window.

Maybe they're not trash. Maybe they're just... incomplete. Practice for something more.

There's a handwritten note tucked into the book, and I almost miss it until it flutters out when I turn a page.

*Annie—The artist on page 47 started out sketching in a notebook during his lunch breaks. Now his work is in museums. Don't throw away your napkins. —Chris*

I read it three times.

He knows. He noticed that I throw away my sketches, and he's telling me not to. He sees my talent before I'm willing to see it myself.

I press the note carefully back into the book and set it on my nightstand, turning off the lamp.

In the darkness, I let myself think the dangerous thought I've been suppressing all week:

Chris Donovan likes me.

Not just as a friendly malt shop girl. Not just as someone convenient to talk to. He likes me enough to think about me when we're apart. Enough to bring me gifts that show he's paying attention. Enough to encourage dreams I haven't dared to voice.

And the even more terrifying thought:

I like him back.

Not just because he's handsome or charming or from a good family. I like the way he sees me—really sees me, the parts I try to hide. I like his laugh and his stories about paint colors and the way he admits he doesn't know what he's doing with his life. I like that he wants to teach instead of own hardware stores and that he thinks cherry malts are worth a daily visit.

I like him. Genuinely, thoroughly, heart-racingly like him.

Betty's right. Hope is terrifying.

But maybe—just maybe—it's worth it.
