# Chapter 28: Understanding Leagues

The jukebox lights were still glowing softly when Chris selected another song. More nickels from his pocket—how many had he brought? Had he planned to spend the whole evening playing music for me?

This time it was "Dream Lover" by Bobby Darin. Another one of my favorites, another song he'd learned I liked during all those afternoons of conversation.

As the music started, Chris pulled me back into his arms, and we began moving again. Slower this time. More relaxed. Like we'd settled something between us and now could just exist in this moment without the weight of all those unanswered questions pressing down.

"Can I tell you something?" I asked after we'd been swaying for a while.

"Anything."

"I've spent my whole life thinking about leagues." The words felt strange coming out, but I needed to say them. Needed to articulate what I was starting to understand. "You know—out of someone's league. Like there's this hierarchy and some people are higher up and some are lower and you're not supposed to cross those lines."

Chris didn't interrupt, just kept us moving in gentle circles.

"And I always put myself at the bottom," I continued. "Not even consciously, really. It was just this accepted truth. Diane was in a higher league. The popular girls at school. Sandra Mitchell. You." I paused. "Especially you."

"Annie—"

"Let me finish." I took a breath. "I spent so much energy convincing myself that you were out of my league. That boys like you didn't date girls like me. That the social differences were insurmountable. That trying to be with you would be like... I don't know, like trying to jump to a ledge that was too high. I'd just fall and embarrass myself."

I felt Chris's arms tighten slightly around me.

"But tonight," I said slowly, working through the thought as I spoke, "when I was sitting here in the dark, crying because I'd run away from the dance, I realized something. The ledge was never too high. I was the one who decided it was impossible to reach. I was the one who built this whole system of leagues and hierarchies in my head and then used it as an excuse to stay safe."

"You were protecting yourself," Chris said gently.

"I was hiding," I corrected. "There's a difference. Protecting yourself is about safety from real danger. But hiding is about being too afraid to even try. And I've been hiding my whole life, Chris. Behind the counter. Behind being the invisible girl. Behind this story I told myself about not being good enough."

We turned slowly, the familiar malt shop rotating around us like a carousel.

"Sandra Mitchell isn't in a higher league than you," Chris said firmly. "She's just in a different league. One with different rules and different prizes. But that doesn't make it better. Just different."

"But the world sees it as better," I pointed out. "The world sees her family's money and status and connections and says that's worth more than what I have."

"The world is wrong about a lot of things." Chris pulled back slightly so he could look at my face. "And even if the world sees those differences, that doesn't mean we have to accept the world's valuation. Sandra has money and status. You have talent and depth and the ability to see people for who they really are. Why is one worth more than the other?"

"Because money and status can buy things. Can open doors."

"And talent and empathy can create things. Can forge genuine connections." He shook his head. "I'm not saying the material differences don't exist, Annie. I know they do. I know it's easier to pursue art school when you don't have to worry about tuition. I know having connections opens doors that might otherwise stay closed. I'm not naive about privilege."

"Then what are you saying?"

"I'm saying that the question isn't whether those differences exist. The question is whether we let them define what's possible between two people who care about each other." His voice was intense now, passionate. "Whether we accept that some people are just supposed to stay in their assigned places, or whether we believe that connection and authentic feeling matter more than arbitrary social categories."

I thought about the Summer Social, about all those people in their expensive clothes and their practiced social graces. About how small I'd felt standing among them, how certain I'd been that I didn't belong.

"But they judge," I said quietly. "People like Jennifer and Tommy's girlfriend. They see someone like me with someone like you and they make assumptions. They call me 'the help' and laugh about it being charitable."

"They do," Chris agreed, anger flickering across his face. "And that's cruel and small-minded and says everything about them and nothing about you. But Annie, people like that will always find something to judge. If it wasn't your job, it would be your clothes. If it wasn't your clothes, it would be something else. Their judgment isn't based on who you actually are. It's based on their need to feel superior."

"So what do we do about it?"

"We decide it doesn't matter." He said it simply, like it was the easiest thing in the world. "We decide that their opinion of us doesn't get to define our reality. That Jennifer's catty remarks don't change what we mean to each other. That Sandra's subtle condescension doesn't make you any less valuable."

I wanted to believe it was that simple. That you could just decide not to care what people thought and make it so.

"But what about when it's not just cattiness?" I pressed. "What about when it's real obstacles? When your father disapproves of me dating you because I'm not from the right kind of family? When your college friends don't understand why you're with someone who didn't go to university? When—"

"Then we deal with those obstacles as they come," Chris interrupted. "Together. We don't preemptively give up because we're imagining all the ways it might be hard."

He stopped our movement, standing still in the middle of the malt shop with his hands on my waist, looking at me with that intensity that always made me feel exposed and seen in equal measure.

"Annie, here's what I've learned this summer. The real leagues—the ones that actually matter—aren't about money or status or who your family knows. They're about whether you're brave enough to be honest. Whether you choose authenticity over performance. Whether you see people or just see their social labels."

He touched my face gently, his thumb brushing my cheekbone.

"By that measure? You're not in a lower league than Sandra Mitchell. You're not in a lower league than anyone. You're in a league of people who are brave enough to be real, even when it's scary. Even when it would be easier to hide. And that's the only league I want to be in too."

I felt something shift inside me—not a sudden transformation, but a gradual loosening of beliefs I'd held so tightly for so long. The idea that I wasn't good enough, that I didn't deserve beautiful things, that boys like Chris were supposed to be with girls like Sandra.

What if all of that was just a story I'd been telling myself?

What if the truth was simpler and more complicated all at once—that people were people, that connection was connection, that love didn't care about social hierarchies or family names or which side of the tracks you grew up on?

"I'm scared," I admitted, but it felt different saying it now. Less like a barrier and more like just a fact, something that was true but didn't have to stop me.

"I know," Chris said. "But can I tell you something? Being scared means you're paying attention. It means you understand that this matters, that there are stakes, that it's not just a casual summer romance that you can walk away from without it hurting."

"What is it then?" I asked. "If it's not casual?"

"I think you know what it is." His voice was soft but certain. "I think you've known for a while, just like I have."

I did know. Had known since somewhere around the tenth time he'd come back to the malt shop, since the day he'd brought me that book about art, since the afternoon he'd told me about wanting to teach instead of taking over his father's business.

This wasn't casual. This wasn't charity or kindness or summer boredom.

This was real.

"So what do we do about it?" I asked, echoing my earlier question but meaning something different now.

"We choose it," Chris said simply. "We choose to be brave enough to try. We choose each other over what's easy or expected or safe. We choose to build our own world where the old rules about leagues and social hierarchies don't apply."

"And when people judge us?"

"We let them." He pulled me closer. "We let them judge and we keep choosing each other anyway. Because their judgment doesn't change what's true. It doesn't change that when I'm with you, I feel more myself than I do anywhere else. It doesn't change that you see me—really see me—in a way no one else does. It doesn't change that this is real."

The song was winding down now, Bobby Darin's voice fading into the final notes.

"You make it sound simple," I said, but I was smiling now, feeling something like hope unfurling in my chest.

"It's not simple," Chris admitted. "It's probably going to be complicated and messy and sometimes really hard. But the alternative—walking away because we're scared of what other people think, because we've bought into some arbitrary system of who's allowed to be with whom—that's worse. That's letting fear decide our lives."

Mr. Henderson had said almost the same thing. Don't let fear decide your life.

Maybe they were both right.

Maybe being brave didn't mean not being scared. Maybe it just meant choosing to try anyway, choosing to believe that some things—some people—were worth the risk.

"Okay," I said, the word coming out stronger than I expected. "Okay. No more hiding behind the excuse of leagues or social differences. No more deciding I'm not good enough before giving this a real chance. No more letting other people's judgments determine what I'm allowed to want."

"Yeah?" Chris's face lit up.

"Yeah." I nodded, feeling the certainty settle into my bones. "We try. Really try. And we figure out the obstacles as they come instead of using them as reasons not to start."

"Together," Chris added.

"Together," I agreed.

And standing there in the malt shop with "Dream Lover" fading into silence, I finally understood what everyone had been trying to tell me.

The leagues I'd worried about so much—they were never real. They were just stories we told ourselves to avoid taking risks, to stay safely in our assigned places, to not reach for things that scared us.

But I was done with that story.

I was ready to write a new one.
