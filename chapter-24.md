# Chapter 24: Empty Malt Shop Conversation

I let Chris into the malt shop and immediately wished I hadn't.

In the small, dark space, there was nowhere to hide from him. Nowhere to retreat to when his presence filled up all the air and made it hard to think straight. He stood just inside the door, still in his perfect suit, looking at me like I was something precious that had broken.

And maybe I was broken. Maybe I'd always been broken, and tonight had just made it visible.

"Come sit," Chris said gently, gesturing to the stools at the counter. "Please. Let's talk about this."

But I didn't want to sit beside him like we were back to our afternoon routine, pretending nothing had changed. I stayed where I was, arms wrapped around myself, the chrome counter between us like a barrier.

"Annie." He moved closer, careful, like I might bolt. "Talk to me. What happened tonight?"

"I told you. I don't belong in your world. Your friends made that very clear."

"What did they say?" His jaw was tight, anger simmering beneath the surface. "Exactly. What did they say to you?"

I didn't want to repeat it. Didn't want to give Sandra's polite condescension or Jennifer's casual cruelty more power than they already had. But Chris was looking at me with such intensity, such determination to understand, that the words came spilling out anyway.

"Sandra told me about how kind you are. How you've always included the kids others ignore. How generous your spirit is." I heard the bitterness in my own voice. "She made it very clear that this—us—is just another example of you being inclusive. Of you being charitable to people who are different."

Chris's hands clenched into fists. "She had no right—"

"And then Jennifer." I pushed on, needing to get it all out now. "I heard her talking to Tommy. Talking about how sweet it was that you were giving the malt shop girl a nice evening. How charitable." I met his eyes. "And then she called me 'the help.' Said bringing the help to the Summer Social was quite a statement."

The fury that crossed Chris's face was immediate and fierce. "Jesus, Annie. I'm so sorry. I never should have left you alone with them. I should have known—"

"Known what? That your friends would see me exactly as I am?" I shook my head. "They weren't wrong, Chris. That's the thing. They said what everyone was thinking. What you were probably thinking too, even if you're too kind to say it."

"That's not true—"

"Isn't it?" I felt tears threatening again but pushed through them. "Be honest with yourself. You're Chris Donovan. You're in college, your family owns a successful business, you belong to the Yacht Club, you go to events like the Summer Social because that's your world. And I'm the girl who makes your malts. That's not me being self-deprecating, that's just reality."

Chris was quiet for a moment, and I waited for him to agree. To admit that yes, the distance between us was too great, that this summer had been a nice diversion but nothing that could last into the real world.

Instead, he walked around the counter until there was nothing between us.

"You want reality?" His voice was low, controlled. "Here's reality. Yes, I'm in college. Yes, my family has money and I grew up with certain privileges. Yes, I know people like Sandra Mitchell and yes, I've been going to events like the Summer Social my whole life." He took a breath. "And every single one of those things is less real to me than sitting at this counter talking to you."

I blinked, confused.

"You know what I do at those events?" Chris continued. "I perform. I smile and make small talk and pretend to care about who's dating whom and which families went where for vacation. I play the part everyone expects—the good son, the college boy, the heir to the hardware empire. And I'm so tired of performing, Annie. So tired of being what everyone thinks I should be."

He stepped closer, and I could see the emotion in his eyes.

"But here? In this malt shop? Talking to you?" His voice dropped. "I don't have to perform. I can tell you that I want to be a teacher instead of running my father's business and you don't judge me. I can admit that I'm terrified of disappointing everyone and you understand. I can just be Chris—not Chris Donovan, hardware heir, but just... me."

My throat was tight. "Chris..."

"You see me," he said simply. "Really see me. Not the version everyone else wants, but who I actually am. Do you have any idea how rare that is? How much that matters?"

"But your friends—"

"Are people I grew up with. People I've known my whole life who don't actually know anything important about me." Chris's expression was fierce. "Sandra Mitchell has no idea that I want to teach. Tommy doesn't know that I spend my afternoons at a malt shop because talking to you is the best part of my day. My own mother doesn't know that the thought of taking over the hardware business makes me feel like I'm suffocating."

He took my hands, and I was too stunned to pull away.

"But you know all of that," he said. "You know the things that matter. The real things. So don't tell me that they understand my world better than you do. They understand the performance. You understand me."

I stared at him, my carefully constructed defenses crumbling. "But the social differences are real. Your father owns businesses and mine works at a shipyard. You're going to inherit a company and I'm trying to figure out if I can afford community college. Those things matter, Chris. You can't just wish them away."

"You're right," he said, and my heart sank until he continued. "Those differences are real. And I'm not going to pretend the world doesn't see them or that some people won't judge us for them."

"Then how can this possibly work?" My voice cracked on the question. "How can we bridge that gap when everyone is watching and judging and waiting for us to fail?"

"Because the question isn't whether the world sees those differences," Chris said firmly. "The question is whether we let those differences define what's possible between us. Whether we're going to let Sandra Mitchell and Jennifer and everyone else at that dance tell us what we're allowed to want."

He stepped even closer, until I could see the flecks of gold in his brown eyes, until his presence surrounded me completely.

"Annie, I don't want you to become like the girls at that dance. I don't want you to fit into that world. I want to be part of yours."

"My world?" I almost laughed, the sound bitter. "My world is making malts and living in a tiny house and worrying about whether we can afford new shoes. My world is secondhand dresses and borrowed jewelry and knowing I'll probably never travel farther than Philadelphia. Why would you want that when you could have so much more?"

"Because in your world, I don't have to pretend," Chris said, his voice intense. "In your world, conversations are real and people matter more than appearances. When you create something beautiful—those sketches you make—you don't diminish it or hide it or apologize for it. You just let it be what it is. You let yourself be what you are, even when you're scared."

He moved closer, until I could feel the warmth radiating from him, until all I could see was the earnestness in his eyes and the determination written across his features.

"I'm not asking you to join my world, Annie," he continued. "I'm not asking you to become someone you're not or to pretend you belong in spaces that make you uncomfortable. I'm asking if I can be part of yours. If we can build something that's ours—not theirs, not defined by what anyone else thinks we should be. A world where I can teach and you can make art and neither of us has to perform for anyone's approval."

I wanted to believe him. God, I wanted to believe him so badly it hurt.

"What happens when you go back to college?" I whispered, voicing the fear that had been eating at me since the moment he'd first asked me to the dance. "What happens when you're at school with girls like Sandra, girls who understand your world and fit into it effortlessly? When I'm still here making malts and you're hours away living a completely different life? What happens when the distance isn't just social class but actual miles between us?"

"I don't know," Chris admitted, and I appreciated his honesty even as it scared me. "I don't have all the answers, Annie. I can't promise it'll be easy or that we won't have to work at it. Long distance is hard. The social differences are real. Your world and mine—the worlds we came from—they're different."

He paused, his hands still holding mine, grounding me.

"But I know that walking away from this—from you—because we're scared of what might not work is the biggest mistake I could make. I'd rather try and maybe fail than never try at all. Because you make me want to be honest. You make me want to be brave enough to choose what I actually want instead of what's expected."

A tear slid down my cheek, hot and unbidden. "I'm so scared, Chris. I'm so scared of hoping for this and losing it. Of believing I deserve it and finding out I was wrong."

"I know." He brushed the tear away with his thumb, the touch gentle and reverent. "I'm scared too. But can I tell you what scares me more than the distance or the differences or what anyone else thinks?"

I nodded, unable to speak, my throat too tight with emotion.

"Letting you believe that you're not worth fighting for. That this isn't real. That I'm just being kind to the invisible girl." His voice was rough with emotion. "Because that's the biggest lie of all, Annie. You're not invisible to me. You never were."

And standing there in the dark malt shop, with the chrome gleaming around us and the ghost of a hundred afternoons hanging in the air, I finally let myself believe it.

Not that everything would be easy. Not that the world would stop judging or that the differences would disappear.

But that Chris saw me. Really saw me. And that maybe, just maybe, that was enough to start with.
