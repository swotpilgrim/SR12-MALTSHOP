# Chapter 18: Encouragement

The week after I told Chris no felt like watching summer through a gray filter.

He still came at three o'clock, still ordered his cherry malt, still smiled. But something had shifted—a carefulness that hadn't been there before. Our conversations stayed surface-level. Safe topics that didn't venture anywhere close to what we'd lost.

He never stayed as long anymore. Twenty minutes, maybe thirty, then he'd leave with a promise to see me tomorrow. The afternoons felt shorter without him.

I told myself this was better. This was what I'd wanted—to stay safe behind the counter. But every time he walked out, I felt the ache of those deeper conversations where we'd talked about dreams and fears and futures.

Betty watched it all with barely concealed frustration, her dark eyes tracking Chris's increasingly brief visits. But she didn't say anything. Not until Tuesday afternoon, when Mr. Henderson called her into his office and left me alone with Ruth during a rare lull.

"Do you think Chris will ask someone else to the Summer Social?" Ruth asked, wiping down the already-clean counter with unnecessary vigor.

The question hit me like a physical blow. I hadn't thought about that possibility—that Chris might take someone else, that I might have to hear about him dancing with Sandra Mitchell or one of the other girls who'd been eyeing him all summer.

"I don't know," I managed. "Maybe."

"That would be awful," Ruth said with the dramatic certainty of sixteen. "You two are perfect for each other. Everyone can see it."

"We're friends," I said, the word tasting like ash. "That's all."

"Friends don't look at each other the way you two do."

Before I could respond, Betty emerged from Mr. Henderson's office with an expression that meant business. She marched straight to me, grabbed my arm, and steered me toward the back room.

"Ruth, watch the counter," she called over her shoulder.

"Betty, what are you—"

"We need to talk." She pushed me gently but firmly into the storage room and closed the door. "About you and Chris and this ridiculous situation you've created."

I crossed my arms. "There's nothing to talk about."

"The hell there isn't." Betty rarely cursed—Mr. Henderson didn't allow it. "Annie, I've been patient. But I can't watch you do this to yourself anymore."

"Do what?"

"Let fear rob you of something wonderful. That boy is crazy about you. You feel the same way about him. But you're so scared of getting hurt that you're guaranteeing it by pushing him away."

"I'm not pushing him away. We're still friends."

"You think I don't see how miserable you both are? How you watch the door every afternoon waiting for him, then force yourself to be distant when he arrives?"

"I'm protecting myself," I said quietly.

"From what? From happiness? From someone who actually sees you and likes what he sees?" Betty grabbed my shoulders, forcing me to meet her eyes. "Annie Palmer, you are letting fear make all your decisions. And I'm here to tell you that you're making a mistake."

"You don't understand—"

"Then help me understand. Because from where I'm standing, a wonderful boy asked you to a dance. You like him. He likes you. The only thing standing in your way is your own fear of not being good enough. But who decided you're not good enough? Who gets to make that call?"

The question hung in the air between us. I wanted to list all the reasons—my lack of money, my hand-me-down clothes, my invisible position behind this counter. But Betty knew all of that already. She knew my life, knew my circumstances, and she still thought I deserved to go to that dance.

"What if I embarrass him?" I whispered.

"What if you don't?" Betty countered. "What if you go to that dance and have a wonderful time? What if you wear a pretty dress and dance with a boy who thinks you hung the moon? What if you stop assuming the worst and give yourself a chance?"

Before I could answer, the door opened and Ruth poked her head in.

"Sorry to interrupt, but Mr. Henderson wants to see Annie."

Betty released my shoulders with one last meaningful look. "This conversation isn't over."

I followed Ruth out to the main shop, my heart hammering. Had I done something wrong? Mr. Henderson almost never called me into his office.

He was waiting by the register. "Annie, got a minute?"

"Of course, Mr. Henderson."

He led me to his small office and gestured for me to sit while he leaned against the filing cabinet.

"You're a good worker, Annie. Best I've had in twenty years."

"Thank you, sir."

"You're punctual, reliable, make a damn fine malt. You know why you're so good at this job?" He didn't wait for an answer. "Because you pay attention. You notice things. You see people."

"I just try to do a good job," I said quietly.

"You make people feel seen." He was quiet for a moment. "My wife was like that. Mary. She noticed things, remembered details. Made everyone feel like they mattered."

Mr. Henderson rarely talked about his late wife. I stayed silent, sensing he had more to say.

"Mary was scared of things too. Scared of taking chances, scared of looking foolish. When I first asked her to step out with me, she said no. Said a girl like her didn't belong with a boy like me—I was going to inherit this shop, and she was just a secretary at the shipyard."

My throat tightened. The parallel wasn't lost on me.

"But I kept asking. And finally, her best friend told her something that changed her mind." He looked at me directly. "She said: 'The only difference between you and the girls he could ask is that they believe they deserve to be asked. Why give them all the power?'"

I absorbed that, feeling the words settle into my chest.

"Mary told me, years later, that she regretted all the time we wasted because she was scared. She wished she'd been braver sooner." Mr. Henderson's expression softened. "I see you making the same mistake, Annie. And I'd hate for you to have the same regrets."

"What if I go to that dance and it's a disaster?" The words came out small, scared.

"Then it's a disaster. You'll survive. But what if it's not? What if it's wonderful?" He pushed off from the filing cabinet. "I'm giving you next Saturday evening off. Shop closes at six, and you don't need to be here. What you do with that time is up to you."

"Mr. Henderson—"

"One more thing." He pulled open a desk drawer and retrieved something—a folded napkin. When he opened it, I saw a sketch I'd done weeks ago of the malt shop counter, with the chrome gleaming and the jukebox in the background. I'd thrown it away.

"I've been collecting these," he admitted. "The drawings you throw in the trash. You've got real talent, Annie. The kind that shouldn't be hidden behind a counter—though I'm grateful for your work here."

I stared at the sketch, at my own careful lines capturing a moment of light and shadow.

"My Mary wanted to be a painter," he continued. "But she was too scared to try. She told herself she wasn't good enough, that it was just a hobby, that serious artists were different kinds of people. She died with paints in the closet she'd never opened." His voice was rough. "Don't make her mistakes, Annie. Don't let fear decide your life."

He handed me the sketch, and I took it with shaking hands.

"Think about what I said. And think about whether you're refusing that boy because you don't want to go, or because you're scared to want things."

Betty was waiting when I emerged from the office, and from her expression, I could tell she and Mr. Henderson had coordinated this intervention.

"Well?" she demanded.

"You put him up to that."

"He offered." Betty didn't look the least bit sorry. "Look, Annie, we care about you. We want you to be happy. And we can see that you and Chris have something real. But you're the only one who can decide to be brave enough to reach for it."

Ruth appeared at my other elbow. "I'll teach you to dance," she offered shyly. "During our breaks. The jitterbug, the slow dance, all of it. It's not as hard as you think."

"And I'll help you find a dress," Betty added. "We'll go to the secondhand store, the church donation shop—my cousin Maria really does have a ton of dresses from high school. We'll find something perfect."

I looked between them—Betty fierce and determined, Ruth hopeful and romantic, Mr. Henderson watching from his office doorway with quiet encouragement. My support system, rallying around me with more faith than I had in myself.

"I don't know," I said, but my resistance was weakening.

"Just think about it," Betty urged. "The dance is Saturday. You have time to change your mind."

That evening, I pulled out the sketch Mr. Henderson had saved. I studied my own work with new eyes, seeing what he saw—real talent, real potential. I thought about Mary Henderson with her unopened paints, about a life lived safely but incompletely.

I thought about Chris's disappointed face when I'd told him no. About the loss of those deep conversations that had made me feel truly seen.

I thought about Betty's question: Who decided I wasn't good enough?

And I realized that I had. I'd decided I didn't deserve beautiful things before anyone else could make that judgment. I'd built my own cage and called it safety.

Maybe being brave didn't mean not being scared. Maybe it just meant doing the scary thing anyway.

I pulled out the napkin with Chris's phone number from my nightstand drawer. The numbers were still there, waiting.

I could call him. Tell him I'd changed my mind, that I wanted to go to the dance. That I wanted to try being brave.

The phone sat on the hallway table, just outside my room. Thirty seconds to dial. Thirty seconds to change everything.

My hand was shaking as I reached for it.
