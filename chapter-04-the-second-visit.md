# Chapter 4: The Second Visit

I tell myself I'm not watching the door.

It's just that the afternoon shift has a natural rhythm, and part of that rhythm involves being aware of customer flow. When people enter. When they leave. Whether the shop is getting too crowded or settling into a lull. That's normal. That's part of the job.

The fact that it's three o'clock and I've glanced at the door approximately seven times in the last ten minutes is purely coincidental.

"He's not coming back," I mutter to myself, wiping down the already-spotless counter with more force than necessary.

The truth is, I spent last night lying awake thinking about blue eyes and an easy smile and the way Chris Donovan had looked at me like I was someone worth seeing. Which is ridiculous. He ordered a malt. I made a malt. That's the entire story.

Except Betty's words keep echoing in my head: "Mark my words—he'll be back."

But it's been twenty-four hours, and Seabreeze has three malt shops. The odds of him returning to this specific one, at this specific time, are—

The bell above the door chimes.

I look up and my heart does something complicated in my chest.

Chris Donovan walks in.

He's wearing khaki pants and a light blue button-down with rolled sleeves, but the same easy confidence. His hair is slightly mussed, and there's a smudge of what might be grease on his forearm.

Our eyes meet across the shop, and he smiles. Not a polite customer smile, but genuine.

He's here. He actually came back.

Chris walks directly to the counter and sits on the same stool as yesterday—fourth from the left—like it's already become his designated spot. Like he's a regular instead of someone who's been here exactly once before.

"Hi, Annie," he says, and the fact that he remembers my name sends a little thrill through me that I immediately try to suppress.

"Hi." I put down what I'm holding, willing my hands not to shake. "Back so soon?"

"Couldn't stay away." He glances at the menu. "That cherry malt has been haunting my dreams. Thought about it at least five times today while sorting screws at the hardware store."

"That's... a lot of thinking about a malt."

"When you're organizing three hundred different screw sizes, your mind wanders to more pleasant things." He shakes his head. "That cherry malt definitely qualifies."

Despite myself, I smile. "So you want another one?"

"Please. If you don't mind making two perfect cherry malts in two days."

"It's literally my job," I say, then worry that sounds rude. "I mean, I'm happy to make another one."

"Good." His smile widens. "Because this might become a habit."

I turn away, focusing on making the malt. Two and a half scoops. Cold milk. Four pumps of cherry syrup. Twenty-five seconds in the mixer.

While I work, I'm hyperaware of Chris behind me. Yesterday felt like a fluke. But he came back.

Stop it, Annie. He likes cherry malts. That's all.

But when I set the glass in front of him, he's watching me with an expression that seems like more than appreciation for frozen desserts.

"You make that look effortless," he says.

"Practice." I slide the straw and spoon across. "I've made approximately a thousand malts this summer."

"Well, you've perfected it." He takes a drink, genuine pleasure on his face. "Yep. Just as good as I remembered."

A warm feeling blooms in my chest.

Chris settles onto his stool. "So how's your day been?"

"Fine." Then, because he's looking at me like he actually wants to know, I add, "Busy lunch rush. Two dropped ice cream cones and one meltdown over chocolate versus vanilla."

"Ah. The eternal debate." He takes another sip. "For the record, I'm team chocolate for ice cream, but team cherry for malts."

"A diplomatic position."

"What about you? Where do you stand?"

"On what?"

"The chocolate versus vanilla question."

No one's ever asked my preferences before. "Vanilla," I say finally. "It's more versatile. A better canvas for other flavors."

"Like cherry syrup."

"Exactly."

"See, this is expert insight you can only get from the source." Chris gestures with his straw. "I bet most people don't think about ice cream as a canvas."

"Most people just want something cold and sweet."

"Well, most people are missing out on the craftsmanship."

I duck my head, embarrassed but also pleased. When was the last time someone called what I do craftsmanship?

From across the shop, I can feel Betty's eyes boring into me. She's pretending to wipe down a booth, but I know she's watching.

"How's the hardware store?" I ask. "Besides the screw-organizing?"

"Oh, riveting. Today I helped Mrs. Patterson pick out paint colors. She brought in fifteen different white samples that all looked identical, but apparently 'eggshell' and 'ivory' and 'cream' are distinct concepts."

This makes me laugh—a quick, surprised sound.

"You'd think white would just be white." He shakes his head. "I miss college, where the hardest decision was library or student union."

"What are you studying?"

"Business." The word comes out flat. Then he adds more energy. "It's fine. Practical. My dad's really happy about it."

There's something in the way he says "my dad's really happy" that makes me think Chris maybe isn't.

"What about you? Junior year, right? What do you like? Besides making perfect malts?"

No one ever asks me this. "I, um. School's fine. English is okay. Art class is..." I stop. "I like art."

"Yeah?" He leans forward, genuinely interested. "Like painting? Drawing?"

"Drawing mostly. Just sketches. Nothing serious."

"I bet they're better than you're giving yourself credit for."

How does he sense that I'm downplaying it?

"They're just doodles," I say quickly. "Anyway, I should—"

"Annie!" Mr. Henderson's voice cuts across the shop. "Can you help Ruth with the inventory sheet when you get a minute?"

"Yes, sir."

I glance back at Chris apologetically. "I should—"

"Of course. Don't let me monopolize your time." But he doesn't seem in any hurry to leave.

I help Ruth with the inventory, and when I return ten minutes later, Chris is still there. The malt glass is empty, but he's sitting comfortably, looking around the shop.

"You didn't have to wait," I say.

"I wasn't waiting. I was observing." He gestures around. "This place has good bones. That jukebox is amazing—is it original?"

"I think so. Mr. Henderson's owned the shop for twenty years. His wife picked it out, before..." I trail off.

Chris nods like he understands. "It's a good space. Feels authentic."

"Unlike Donovan Hardware?" I tease, surprising myself.

He laughs. "Oh, Donovan Hardware is definitely trying hard. My grandfather built it to impress. Polished wood, brass fixtures. Looks more like a bank."

"Sounds fancy."

"Sounds intimidating." He pulls out his wallet, places money on the counter—more than enough. "But this place? This is welcoming. You can tell people like being here."

"Do you?" The question slips out. "Like being here?"

His eyes meet mine, and there's something in his expression that makes my breath catch.

"Yeah," he says quietly. "I really do."

I don't know what to say to that, so I just take the money and ring it up, hyper-aware of the silence between us that somehow doesn't feel awkward.

Chris stands, pushing in his stool with the same careful courtesy as yesterday. "I'll see you tomorrow, Annie."

Not "maybe I'll be back" or "if I'm in the area." Just a statement of fact: he'll see me tomorrow.

"See you tomorrow," I manage.

He waves and heads for the door, and I watch him go, still holding the bills he left.

The bell chimes. He's gone.

"OH. MY. GOSH."

I jump about a foot in the air. Betty has materialized directly beside me again, eyes wide as saucers, practically vibrating with excitement.

"Betty—"

"He came back! I told you he'd come back! And did you hear him? 'I'll see you tomorrow.' Not maybe, not possibly—definitely tomorrow!"

"He likes the cherry malts," I say weakly.

"Annie Palmer, I swear, you are the most stubborn girl in all of Seabreeze. That boy is not coming here every single day for cherry malts. He's coming for you."

"That's ridiculous. He barely knows me."

"Which is exactly why he's coming back—to get to know you better!" Betty looks like she wants to shake some sense into me. "This is how it works! Boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy comes back to see girl again!"

"Or boy likes cherry malts, boy comes back for more malts."

Betty throws her hands up in exasperation. "You're impossible. Fine. Believe whatever you want. But when he shows up tomorrow—and he will—maybe think about whether boys usually go to this much effort for frozen desserts."

She stalks off to bus tables, muttering about hopeless cases and stubborn girls who can't see what's right in front of them.

I stand at the counter, turning Chris's money over in my hands. See you tomorrow. The words echo in my head, carrying a weight I don't quite know what to do with.

From his position at the register, Mr. Henderson catches my eye. He doesn't say anything, but there's something in his expression—a knowing look, maybe. The slightest nod.

Like he agrees with Betty.

Like he sees something I'm too afraid to see.

I push the thought away and get back to work, wiping counters and refilling dispensers and preparing for the dinner rush. But all afternoon, two words keep running through my head on an endless loop:

Tomorrow. He said tomorrow.

And despite everything I tell myself about not hoping, not expecting, not setting myself up for disappointment, there's a small, stubborn spark of something in my chest.

Something that feels dangerously like anticipation.
