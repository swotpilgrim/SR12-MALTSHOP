# Chapter 1: Behind the Counter

The key to the Seabreeze Malt Shop feels heavier than it should in my hand as I fumble with it in the pre-dawn darkness. The lock clicks open, and I push through the door, breathing in the lingering scent of yesterday's vanilla and chocolate syrup.

I find the light switches automatically—one for the main dining area, two for the counter lights, three for the back kitchen. The fluorescent tubes flicker before flooding the shop with brightness, making the chrome counter gleam.

Everything has its place here, its routine, its order. Including me.

I tie on my pink uniform apron and begin the opening ritual I could do in my sleep. The Wurlitzer jukebox in the corner gets fed its first nickel of the day. I select number A-7, and Dion's voice fills the empty shop with "Dream Lover." The song makes me think of girls who have boys waiting for them, boys who actually see them when they walk by.

The chrome counter needs wiping even though it was clean when I left last night. I run my cloth over the surface anyway, watching my distorted reflection bend and blur in the polished metal. The vinyl-topped stools get a quick check—all six of them lined up perfectly, red seats catching the overhead lights. Mr. Henderson is particular about the stools. He says they should look like soldiers at attention, ready for customers.

Behind the counter, I arrange the silver malt mixer cups in order of size, check that the ice cream freezer is at exactly the right temperature, make sure the syrup pumps are primed and ready. Chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, cherry. The cherries are my favorite—not to eat, but to watch when I'm making a malt. The way the red syrup spirals through white ice cream and milk, turning everything pink before it all blends together into something perfect.

The morning settles around me like a comfortable coat. This is what I'm good at—making perfect malts, keeping the counter clean, remembering orders, staying invisible while life happens around me.

The door bursts open at six-thirty exactly, and Betty Russo explodes into the shop the way she does everything—with too much energy and not enough concern for volume.

"Annie! You will not believe what happened at the bonfire last night!" She's already untying her apron from its hook, dark curls bouncing. "Bobby Morrison tried to jump over the fire to impress Linda Shaw and totally singed his jeans!"

I smile, wiping down the counter. "Is he okay?"

"His pride is wounded more than anything." Betty ties her apron, still talking. "But seriously, Annie, you should have come. Everyone was asking where you were."

No one was asking where I was. Betty means well, but I know better.

"I was tired from the shift," I say. "And I had to help my mother with some mending."

Betty makes a face—the same one she makes every time I give her a reasonable excuse. "You're sixteen, not sixty. You should be singing around bonfires, not sewing hems."

Before I can respond, the back door opens and Mr. Henderson arrives, bringing with him the smell of his morning pipe tobacco and the general store coffee he drinks from the same thermos every single day. He's fifty-eight, widowed for six years, and runs this shop with the same quiet precision he probably brought to his marriage.

He grunts at us—not unfriendly, just his way of saying good morning—and surveys the shop with his sharp blue eyes. He takes in the gleaming counter, the arranged stools, the humming jukebox. His gaze rests on me for a moment, and he nods once.

"Good work, Annie."

Two words, but they settle something in my chest. Mr. Henderson doesn't waste words on false praise.

The morning rush starts around seven—fishermen coming off early boats, construction workers heading to Shore Road, summer people wanting breakfast. Betty handles the booth customers while I take the counter, and we fall into our rhythm like dancers who've practiced the same routine a hundred times.

Mrs. Henderson sits at her usual spot, third stool from the left. She orders a vanilla malt with extra whipped cream on top, cherry on the side. I noticed weeks ago that she only orders the extra whipped cream on days when her smile doesn't quite reach her eyes. Today's a whipped cream day.

"You're an angel, Annie," she says when I set the glass in front of her. "You always know exactly what I need."

I murmur something modest and move on. That's what I do—I notice things, remember things, make things the way people need them. But nobody really sees me doing it. I'm just part of the scenery, like the chrome counter or the checkered floor.

By mid-morning, the rush has ebbed, and Betty leans against the counter next to me, filing her nails and humming along to "All I Have to Do Is Dream" playing on the jukebox.

"So Bobby Morrison," she says casually, "asked about you."

My hands pause in the middle of slicing lemons. "What?"

"Well, he asked if you ever came to beach stuff. I said you were always working." She glances at me sideways. "He's nice, Annie. Not the brightest bulb, but nice. And he's got that new Chevrolet his dad bought him."

"Betty—"

"I'm just saying! You never even give yourself a chance. You're pretty, you know. Or you could be, if you'd try a little."

The words sting more than they should, probably because they echo what my mother says at least once a week. If you'd just fix your hair differently, Annie. If you'd wear a little lipstick, Annie. If you'd try to be more like Diane, Annie.

"I like my hair the way it is," I say quietly, returning to the lemons with more force than necessary.

Betty sighs but drops the subject. She's a good friend—knows when to push and when to let things go.

The afternoon arrives with summer heat and a different crowd. Teenagers with sand on their feet, ordering root beer floats and chocolate sundaes. Mothers with small children who want cones—two scoops, different flavors.

I watch them through the window sometimes—the beautiful people walking by on Ocean Avenue. Girls with shining ponytails in full skirts and fitted blouses. Boys in clean jeans and white t-shirts, hair slicked back with Brylcreem, arms around those perfect girls' shoulders.

They never look at me. Or if they do, they look through me, at the menu on the glass. Never at me.

During a quiet moment, when Betty's in the back restocking napkins and Mr. Henderson's at the register counting the morning receipts, I pull out a napkin and my pencil. My hand moves almost without thinking, sketching the view from behind the counter—the chrome edge in the foreground, the red stools marching away in a line, the jukebox in the corner with its bubbling colors, the window showing the street beyond.

It's nothing special. Just a quick sketch, lines and shadows showing a moment in time, a perspective only I ever see. I study it for a moment, notice that I've captured the way the afternoon light comes through the window at this exact time of day, creating long rectangles on the floor.

Then I crumple it up and toss it in the trash.

That's what I do with all my drawings. They're nothing, really—just doodles, just ways to pass the slow moments. Not real art. Not something anyone would want to see.

"Why do you do that?" Ruth Anderson, the new girl who started last week, is standing at the end of the counter watching me. She's sixteen like me, sweet but scattered, still learning which syrup pump is which.

"Do what?"

"Throw them away. Your drawings are really good."

I shrug and turn away, busying myself with rearranging the already-perfectly-arranged syrup bottles. "They're just doodles."

Ruth looks like she wants to say something else, but a customer calls for a refill and the moment passes.

The afternoon stretches on. I make malts and sundaes, wipe down the counter, reload napkin dispensers. Betty talks about boys and beach parties and the new Elvis movie at the Starlight Drive-In. Mr. Henderson does paperwork in the back office, emerging occasionally with his quiet, assessing gaze.

And I exist in the spaces between—behind the counter, making perfect malts that people consume and forget, watching life happen around me while I remain safely invisible.

By six o'clock, my feet ache and I smell like vanilla and chocolate. Betty's left already—a date with some boy. Ruth's cleaning tables, her apron stained with strawberry syrup. Mr. Henderson's locking up the register.

I wipe down the counter one final time, the chrome gleaming under my cloth. The jukebox plays "Dream Lover" again—someone must have selected it, or maybe it's just cycling through the same songs. Dion's voice asks for someone to call his own, someone to hold in his arms.

I hum along without really meaning to, running my cloth in slow circles over the counter. The words drift around me, about finding someone who makes dreams come true, about not being alone anymore.

The shop empties out gradually. The last customer leaves. Mr. Henderson tells me good night and I hear his truck start up. Ruth finishes and waves goodbye, hurrying to meet her mother.

And then it's just me and the chrome counter and the jukebox singing about dreams.

I untie my apron, hang it on its hook. Turn off the lights in reverse order—three for the back kitchen, two for the counter, one for the dining area. Lock the door and step out into the summer evening, the heat of the day still radiating from the sidewalk.

Tomorrow I'll do it all again. Open the shop, make perfect malts, watch life happen around me while I remain invisible. It's what I'm good at, after all—being the girl behind the counter, the one who serves while others are served.

And that's okay. Really, it is.

I've accepted my role. I'm invisible, and invisible is safe.

Nobody can be disappointed in you if they don't really see you to begin with.
