# Chapter 2: Diane's Visit

I'm restocking the whipped cream canisters when the bell above the door chimes, and I look up to see my sister.

Diane doesn't just enter a room—she arrives. Even here, in the modest Seabreeze Malt Shop, she looks like she stepped out of a magazine. Her hair is perfectly styled in soft waves, not a strand out of place despite the summer humidity turning mine into a frizzy mess. Her pale yellow sundress makes her skin glow, and her white gloves are spotless.

Behind her, Richard follows with the patient expression of a man who's learned that Diane sets the pace. He's wearing a suit despite the heat. Richard's twenty-four, works for Atlantic Insurance, and according to every conversation since the wedding, he has excellent prospects.

"Annie!" Diane's smile is bright and genuine. Whatever else I might feel about our relationship, I've never doubted that she loves me. She just doesn't understand me. "I told Richard we absolutely had to stop by and see where you work. Isn't it darling?"

She says "darling" the way someone might say "quaint" or "sweet"—words that sound like compliments but carry the weight of something smaller than expected.

"Hi, Diane." I wipe my hands on my apron. "Hi, Richard."

"Annie." Richard nods politely. He's always polite, always proper. I suspect that's one of the things my mother loves about him.

"We're on our way back from Wilmington," Diane says, sliding onto a stool at the counter—third from the left, Mrs. Henderson's usual spot. It's odd seeing Diane at the counter instead of in a booth, but she's chosen it, which means I'll have to stand right in front of her while she talks. "I have so much to tell you! But first, I'm absolutely dying for something cold. A strawberry sundae, please. Extra strawberries if you can."

"Of course." I reach for a tulip glass from the stack.

Richard sits on the stool next to Diane, looking slightly uncomfortable. Counter stools aren't really built for men in suits. "Just water for me, please," he says.

I nod and start building Diane's sundae while she launches into the updates I know are coming. This is what Diane does—she fills spaces with stories about her life, bright and cheerful narratives that require only minimal response from me.

"Our apartment is finally coming together," she says, pulling off her gloves and setting them neatly on the counter. "You wouldn't believe how much work it is, Annie, setting up a whole household from scratch. Mother helped me with the curtains—she has such an eye for these things. And Richard's mother gave us the most beautiful china service. Twelve place settings! Can you imagine?"

I can't, actually. Twelve place settings suggests dinner parties and social gatherings, a life lived in rooms large enough to host them. I scoop vanilla ice cream into the glass, adding an extra scoop because Diane's always liked generous portions.

"We're planning our first real dinner party for next month," Diane continues. "Richard's boss and his wife, plus two other couples from the office. I'm terrified I'll mess up the menu, but Mother says if I stick to pot roast and her recipe for green bean casserole, I can't go wrong."

I drizzle strawberry syrup over the ice cream, watching the red spiral through the white. Add fresh sliced strawberries—extra, as requested. A generous puff of whipped cream on top, and a final strawberry perched on the peak.

"That looks wonderful," Diane says when I set it in front of her. She picks up her spoon, but doesn't eat yet. "You're so good at this, Annie. You have such careful hands."

It's meant as a compliment, but it lands strange. Careful hands. As if precision with ice cream and syrup is the height of what I'm capable of.

Richard accepts his water with a quiet thank you. He looks around the shop with polite interest—taking in the jukebox, the checkered floor, the chrome fixtures. I wonder what he sees. Quaintness, probably. A summer job his wife's little sister does before she grows up and does something real.

"And guess what?" Diane's eyes light up as she takes her first bite of sundae. "Richard's being considered for a promotion. Tell her, honey."

"It's not definite," Richard says carefully. "But Mr. Patterson mentioned that the assistant manager position might be opening up by fall."

"Isn't that wonderful?" Diane beams. "Just one year out of training, and already they're noticing him. Oh, and Annie, we're planning an anniversary trip to Atlantic City in August! A whole weekend, just the two of us. We're going to stay at the Claridge Hotel and see a show and everything."

I make appropriate sounds of enthusiasm, wiping down the counter even though it doesn't need it. This is Diane's gift—she can fill any silence with the brightness of her life, her plans, her happiness. And it is real happiness. I'm not bitter enough to deny that. Diane loves Richard, loves her apartment, loves planning dinner parties and anniversary trips.

The door chimes again, and my mother enters.

If Diane arrived, Mother descends. She's carrying Annie's lunch—I forgot it this morning—but she stops short when she sees Diane at the counter.

"Diane! What a wonderful surprise!" Mother's whole face transforms. She actually lights up, like someone turned on a lamp behind her eyes. She hurries over, setting my lunch aside to pull Diane into a hug. "I didn't know you were coming today!"

"We were just passing through," Diane says, returning the hug. "I was telling Annie about the dinner party we're planning."

"The dinner party! Yes, we need to discuss the menu again." Mother perches on the stool next to Richard, angling her body toward Diane. "I was thinking you should also do a cucumber salad. Very elegant, very light for summer."

They dive into dinner party logistics while I stand behind the counter, watching. Richard contributes occasional thoughts about his boss's wife's dietary preferences. Mother gestures animatedly, suggesting serving options and table arrangements.

No one asks me anything. No one looks at me.

I'm three feet away, but I might as well be invisible.

"Annie."

I startle. Betty's appeared at my elbow, her voice low. "Ruth needs help with a banana split in the back. Three-banana disaster."

It's a lie—I can see Ruth handling a simple order at the far end of the counter—but I accept the exit gratefully. "Excuse me," I murmur, though none of them notice.

In the storage room, Betty closes the door behind us and leans against it.

"You okay?"

"I'm fine." I start counting napkin stacks that don't need counting.

"Your sister's very..." Betty searches for a word. "Shiny."

Despite everything, I almost smile. "That's one way to put it."

"And your mother practically glows when she looks at her." Betty's voice is careful now, the way you'd handle something fragile. "That must be hard."

"It's just how things are." I move to the syrup supplies, checking levels. "Diane's always been special. Pretty, confident, good at all the things girls are supposed to be good at. She's married now, setting up a household, doing everything right. Mother's proud. That's normal."

"But what about you?"

I don't look at Betty. "What about me?"

"You're smart. You're talented—I've seen your drawings, Annie. You're kind. You're better at this job than anyone else here, including me. Mr. Henderson trusts you with opening duties because you're the most responsible person on staff. But your mother barely looked at you out there."

"Betty—"

"I'm not trying to make you feel bad. I'm just saying... I see you. Even if they don't."

The words lodge somewhere in my chest, uncomfortable and warm at the same time. I focus on the syrup bottles, blinking back something that's definitely not tears because that would be ridiculous.

"We should get back," I say finally.

Betty studies me for another moment, then nods. "Yeah. Okay."

When we return to the counter, Mother and Diane are finishing their conversation. Richard has paid—I see the bills on the counter, more than enough to cover one sundae and a water. Diane's sundae glass is empty except for melted pink streaks.

"That was delicious, Annie," Diane says, standing and pulling her gloves back on. "You really are talented at this."

Talented at making sundaes. Careful hands. Good at this job.

"Thanks," I say.

Mother kisses Diane's cheek, then Richard's. "Drive safely. Call me tomorrow and we'll finalize the menu."

"I will. Bye, Annie!" Diane waves, and then she's sweeping toward the door, Richard following in her wake.

Mother lingers for a moment, glancing at me. "Here's your lunch. Try not to forget it tomorrow."

"I won't."

She looks like she might say something else, but whatever it is remains unspoken. She pats my hand once—a brief, automatic gesture—and follows Diane out the door.

The bell chimes. They're gone.

Betty returns to her section without comment. The other customers continue their conversations. The jukebox plays "Mr. Sandman." Everything continues exactly as it was before Diane arrived.

Except now I feel more invisible than usual.

During my break, I take my lunch to the storage room even though I'm not hungry. I sit on an overturned crate and pull out my small sketchbook and pencil from my apron pocket.

My hand moves across the page, capturing Diane from memory. The tilt of her head when she laughs. The perfect curve of her styled hair. The way her sundress drapes just right. The confidence in her posture, the certainty that she belongs wherever she is.

I study the sketch when it's finished. It's good—I've caught something essential about Diane, the light she carries with her. The way she makes rooms feel brighter just by being in them.

Then I tear the page out, crumple it, and throw it in the trash bin.

I don't know why I always do this—draw people, capture moments, then destroy them. Maybe because keeping them would mean admitting I want something. Admitting that these careful hands might be capable of more than perfect sundaes and clean counters.

Maybe because as long as I destroy the evidence, I can pretend I don't dream of something bigger.

I smooth my apron, check that my work cap is straight, and return to the counter.

Diane has her life—dinner parties, anniversary trips, twelve place settings, and Mother's approval.

I have this: chrome counters, strawberry syrup, the afternoon sun through the window.

It's enough. It has to be.

I've already learned not to hope for anything more.
