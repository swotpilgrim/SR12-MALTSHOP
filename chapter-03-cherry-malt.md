# Chapter 3: Cherry Malt

The afternoon has settled into that lazy lull between lunch rush and dinner preparations. Betty's refilling sugar dispensers at the booth tables, humming along to "Lollipop" playing on the jukebox. I'm restocking supplies behind the counter—checking that we have enough malt powder, counting the maraschino cherry jars, making sure the backup vanilla syrup is within easy reach.

The afternoon sun slants through the front windows, making the chrome counter glow like polished silver. Dust motes float in the light. The bell above the door chimes.

I glance up and feel my stomach do that small, uncomfortable flip it always does when someone who looks like they matter walks in.

He's tall—maybe six feet—with clean-cut looks that belong on university brochures. Dark hair neatly combed, rolled jeans, crisp white t-shirt despite the summer heat. That easy way of moving that confident people have, like the world is designed to accommodate them.

I recognize him vaguely. Seabreeze is small enough that you know faces even if you don't know names. He's one of the Donovan boys—from the family that owns the hardware stores. I think he's away at college most of the year, only home for summers.

My hands freeze on the jar of cherries I'm holding.

This is what happens when certain types of people enter my orbit: I become clumsy. Aware of my body in ways I'm not usually. Conscious that my work cap probably looks ridiculous and my apron has a small stain from chocolate syrup I didn't notice earlier and my hands smell like vanilla extract and ice cream.

Boys like this don't usually sit at the counter. They take booths with their friends or their pretty girlfriends, and I serve them without really being seen, which is fine. Preferable, even.

But he's walking toward the counter.

He slides onto a stool—fourth from the left—and picks up one of the small plastic menus wedged between the napkin dispenser and the straw holder. Studies it with the kind of concentration you'd give to something actually important.

I force myself to move. Put down the cherry jar carefully, wipe my hands on my apron, and approach the counter with what I hope looks like professional competence.

"Hi." My voice comes out steady, thank goodness. "What can I get for you?"

He looks up from the menu, and I make the mistake of meeting his eyes. They're blue—not sky blue or baby blue, but the deep blue of the ocean on a clear day. And they're looking directly at me, not through me.

"What do you recommend?" he asks.

Oh no. This is worse than just taking an order. This requires conversation, opinion, actual interaction.

"Um." I clear my throat. "The chocolate malts are our most popular. They're really good."

He nods slowly, still scanning the menu. "What about cherry? I've been craving something cherry lately."

"The cherry malts are excellent," I say, and it's the truth. I make a perfect cherry malt. "They're one of my favorites to make."

Why did I say that? He doesn't care about my favorite things to make. He just wants to order something.

But he smiles—an easy, genuine smile that crinkles the corners of his eyes. "Then I'll trust your expertise. Cherry malt, please."

"Coming right up."

I turn to the work area, grateful for something to do with my hands. This is where I'm competent, where nervousness fades.

I select a tall glass. Two and a half scoops of vanilla ice cream, cold milk to just below the rim. Here's where it matters: the cherry syrup pump. Most people do three pumps. I do four, because cherry flavor fades faster than chocolate or vanilla, and I'd rather have too much flavor than a malt that tastes like a broken promise.

The malt mixer whirs to life. I watch the pink swirl and blend, counting to twenty-five in my head. Too little mixing and you get chunks. Too much and it becomes soup.

At exactly twenty-five, I shut off the mixer and pour the contents into a fresh tulip glass. Perfect consistency—thick enough to require a straw but thin enough to drink. I add whipped cream on top, then place a bright red cherry at the peak.

Three minutes where I don't have to worry about saying the wrong thing, because I'm doing the one thing I know I'm genuinely good at.

I set the glass on the counter in front of him, along with a long spoon and a wrapped straw. Add a napkin beside it.

"One cherry malt."

"Thank you." He unwraps the straw and takes a long drink.

I should walk away. But I don't move. Some part of me wants to see if I got it right.

He lowers the glass and looks at me with genuine surprise.

"Wow." He takes another drink. "This is really good. Like, genuinely the best cherry malt I've ever had."

Something warm unfurls in my chest. "Thank you."

"No, seriously." He's not just being polite—I can tell the difference. "I've had cherry malts from here to Newark, and this is exceptional. What's your secret?"

"Four pumps of syrup instead of three," I say before I can stop myself. "And exactly twenty-five seconds of mixing time. Not more, not less."

He grins. "A perfectionist. I respect that."

A pause where I should say something, but my mind has gone blank.

"I'm Chris, by the way." He holds out his hand across the counter. "Chris Donovan."

I stare at his hand for half a second too long before taking it. His grip is firm. "Annie. Annie Palmer."

"Nice to meet you, Annie Palmer who makes perfect cherry malts."

My face heats up. "It's just practice."

"Well, practice has paid off." He releases my hand and goes back to his drink, still looking at me like I'm someone worth looking at.

"Are you home from college for the summer?" I ask.

"Yeah, University of Delaware. Just finished freshman year." He takes another drink. "Working at my dad's hardware store for the summer."

I nod like I understand learning a family business.

"What about you?" he asks. "Do you work here year-round, or just summers?"

"Summers. During the school year I'm at Seabreeze High. I'll be a junior next year."

"Ah, so we're both doing the summer job thing." He smiles. "Mine involves inventory and helping customers find the right nails. Yours involves making excellent malts. I think you got the better deal."

I almost smile. "I don't know. I bet hardware stores don't have crying children who dropped their ice cream cones."

"True. Though I did have a grown man almost cry when we were out of his preferred grade of sandpaper."

This startles a laugh out of me—a quick, surprised sound. Chris's smile widens.

"There we go. I was starting to think you were too serious for laughing."

"I'm not—" I stop, not sure how to finish that sentence.

"I'm teasing," he says gently. "Sorry. My mom says I joke when I should be quiet."

"It's okay."

He finishes the malt, using the long spoon to get every last bit. He pulls out his wallet and places two bills on the counter—more than enough.

"Keep the change," he says. "That malt was worth every penny."

"Thank you."

He stands, pushing the stool back neatly. "I'll probably be back. I have a feeling this won't be my last craving for a perfect cherry malt."

"We're open every day until seven," I say, then immediately feel stupid. Obviously we're open.

But Chris just nods. "Good to know. See you around, Annie."

"See you around."

He heads for the door. I watch him go—the easy confidence in his walk, the casual wave before stepping into sunshine.

The bell chimes. He's gone.

"Oh my gosh." Betty's voice makes me jump. She's materialized at my elbow, eyes wide. "Annie Palmer. Who was that?"

"A customer." I pick up the glass and bills.

"That was Chris Donovan, and he was absolutely flirting with you."

"He was not." I ring up the sale. "He ordered a malt. I made a malt."

"He asked your name."

"Customers do that sometimes."

"He shook your hand."

"That's called being polite."

"He made you laugh, Annie."

"Betty." I turn to face her. "He's a college boy from the Donovan family. He was probably just being nice because that's how people like him are. It doesn't mean anything."

Betty looks at me with pity and exasperation. "Sometimes nice people are nice because they're actually nice. And sometimes boys ask for your name because they want to know it."

"Or because they're making conversation."

She sighs. "Fine. But mark my words—he'll be back."

"Maybe. It's a good malt."

Betty laughs and returns to her sugar dispensers, shaking her head.

I wash Chris's glass, dry it, return it to the stack. Wipe down the counter where he sat even though it's already clean. Everything back to normal, back to routine, back to the safe predictability of my work.

But that night, lying in bed with the window open and the sound of distant waves drifting in, I think about blue eyes and an easy smile and the way he said my name like it was worth remembering.

"Annie Palmer who makes perfect cherry malts."

I pull my thin blanket up to my chin and tell myself it doesn't matter. Tell myself Betty's reading too much into a simple transaction.

Tell myself I definitely won't spend tomorrow afternoon checking the clock to see if he comes back.

But I'm not very good at lying, even to myself.
