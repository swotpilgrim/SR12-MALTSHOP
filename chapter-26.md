# Chapter 26: Chris's Declaration

The words hung in the air between us—*what if it does?*—and I felt myself standing at a crossroads. One path led back to safety, to invisibility, to the life I'd always known. The other led toward something terrifying and uncertain and possibly wonderful.

I'd been choosing the first path my whole life.

Maybe it was time to choose differently.

"I don't know how to do this," I admitted, my voice barely above a whisper. "I don't know how to be brave enough for this."

Chris's hands were still cupping my face, his thumbs gentle against my cheeks. "You don't have to know how. You just have to be willing to try."

"But your family—they'll think I'm not good enough. Your mother at the dance, she probably thinks—"

"I don't care what my mother thinks," Chris said firmly. "Or my father, or Sandra Mitchell, or anyone else. This isn't about them, Annie. This is about us. About whether we're going to let other people's opinions determine what we're allowed to want."

"Easy for you to say," I said, but there was no heat behind it. "You're used to defying expectations. I'm used to meeting them."

"No." Chris shook his head. "I'm not used to defying expectations at all. I've spent my whole life doing exactly what my father wants, studying what he wants me to study, preparing to take over a business I don't want. I smile and nod and play the dutiful son while dying a little inside."

I'd never heard him sound so raw before.

"But you," he continued, "you make me want to stop performing. You make me want to tell my father the truth about teaching. You make me want to choose authenticity over approval. So don't tell me it's easy for me to defy expectations. It's terrifying. But you make me want to be brave enough to do it anyway."

I stared at him, seeing the truth of it written across his face. This wasn't easy for him either. He was just as scared as I was—scared of disappointing his family, of choosing wrong, of fighting for something that might not work.

But he was willing to try anyway.

Because of me.

The realization settled into my chest, warm and heavy.

"What are you saying?" I asked. "Exactly. I need to hear you say it plainly, because I've spent all night misunderstanding what this is, and I can't—I need to be sure."

Chris stepped back slightly, and for a moment I thought he was retreating. But then I saw his expression—determined, resolved, like he'd come to a decision.

"Okay. Plain words. No metaphors, no implications, just the truth." He took my hands in his, holding them firmly. "Annie Palmer, I don't want to go back to that dance and pretend I'm interested in Sandra Mitchell. I don't want to date girls from the Yacht Club who fit perfectly into my family's expectations. I don't want to perform my way through life, being who everyone thinks I should be."

His grip tightened.

"I want to come to this malt shop every afternoon at three o'clock and talk to you about art and dreams and all the ways we're both scared of our futures. I want to play 'Earth Angel' on that jukebox and watch you blush. I want to help you apply to art schools and be there when you get accepted because you absolutely will get accepted. I want to tell my father I'm studying education, not business, and have you tell me I'm brave even when I feel like a coward."

My heart was hammering so hard I could barely breathe.

"I want to write you letters when I'm at school because the distance is going to be hard but not impossible. I want to introduce you to people as my girlfriend, not my friend who works at the malt shop. I want everyone to know that you're the girl who makes me want to be honest and real and brave enough to choose what I actually want instead of what's expected."

He moved closer, until I could feel the warmth radiating from him.

"And most of all, I want you to stop believing the lie that you're not good enough. Because you are. You're better than good enough. You're extraordinary, and talented, and one of the most genuinely good people I've ever met. And I don't want to lose you because you're too scared to believe that someone could actually see your worth."

I was crying again—seemed like all I'd done tonight was cry—but these tears felt different. Cleansing, maybe. Or like something hard and closed inside me was finally starting to crack open.

"That's what I'm saying," Chris finished. "Plain enough?"

"Pretty plain," I managed, my voice breaking on a laugh that was half sob.

"So the question is: what are you saying? Because I've laid out everything I want. But I need to know what you want, Annie. Not what you think you should want, not what's safe or expected. What do you actually want?"

And that was the question, wasn't it? Not what I deserved or what made sense or what other people would think. Just: what did I want?

I thought about the summer we'd had. All those afternoons at the counter, talking about things that mattered. The way Chris looked at me like I was someone worth seeing. The books he'd brought me about art, the songs he'd played, the conversations that had made me feel less alone in my own head.

I thought about art school applications gathering dust in my dresser drawer because I'd been too afraid to fill them out. About sketches hidden on napkins because I'd convinced myself they didn't matter. About all the small ways I'd made myself invisible, telling myself it was safer than hoping for more.

And I thought about what Diane had said: *Someone's always going to think you don't belong somewhere. You can either let that stop you, or you can go anyway and decide for yourself if you care.*

Mr. Henderson's words echoed too: *Don't let fear decide your life.*

And Betty's fierce insistence: *Who decided you're not good enough?*

I had. I'd decided. Not Chris's friends, not society, not some cosmic force determining my place in the world. Just me, making myself small before anyone else could do it to me.

But what if I stopped?

What if I chose to believe Chris when he said I was extraordinary?

What if I chose to believe I deserved this?

"I want..." I started, then stopped. Started again. "I want to stop being afraid all the time. I want to fill out those art school applications instead of hiding them. I want to draw without immediately throwing the sketches away. I want to believe that my talent matters."

Chris was watching me intently, hope and encouragement in his eyes.

"And I want..." I took a shaky breath. "I want to be with you. Not as your charity project or your summer kindness. As your girlfriend. As someone you choose deliberately, knowing exactly what it means. Even though it scares me. Even though I don't know how we'll make it work when you're at school and I'm here. Even though your world and my world are so different."

"They don't have to stay different," Chris said quickly. "We can build a world that's ours. One where I'm studying to be a teacher and you're pursuing art and neither of us is performing for anyone else's approval. Where we choose each other not despite our differences but because of who we actually are underneath all the expectations."

"That sounds impossible."

"Or it sounds like the only thing worth doing."

I looked at him—really looked at him—this boy who'd walked into my malt shop asking for a cherry malt and somehow made me want to be braver than I'd ever been. Who'd seen past the uniform and the careful invisibility to the girl underneath. Who'd offered me not rescue, but recognition.

"If I do this—if I say yes to being your girlfriend and yes to believing I deserve good things and yes to trying even though I'm terrified—I need you to promise me something."

"Anything," Chris said immediately.

"Promise me that if this doesn't work, if the distance or the differences or my fear gets too big, you'll tell me. You won't just drift away or make excuses. You'll be honest. Because I'd rather have hard truth than kind lies."

Chris's expression gentled. "I promise. Complete honesty. Even when it's scary."

"And promise me that you'll follow through on telling your father about teaching. That you won't sacrifice your dreams just to make things easier with your family. Because if I'm going to be brave enough to pursue art, you have to be brave enough to pursue teaching."

"Deal," Chris said, a smile starting to break through. "Mutual bravery. Mutual honesty. Mutual support for each other's impossible dreams."

"Okay then." I took a deep breath, feeling like I was about to step off a cliff. "Okay. Yes. I want to be your girlfriend. I want to try this. I want to be brave enough to believe that maybe I deserve to be seen and chosen and..." I couldn't quite say loved yet, couldn't quite believe that part. "And wanted."

The smile that broke across Chris's face was like sunrise.

"You have no idea how long I've been waiting to hear you say that."

"Probably not as long as I've been wanting to believe it."

And then, in the dark malt shop with the chrome gleaming around us and the weight of the whole impossible evening pressing down, Chris pulled me close and held me like I was something precious. Like I mattered. Like I was exactly what he wanted.

And for the first time in my life, I let myself believe it might be true.

Not because it made sense or because anyone else approved or because I'd finally figured out how to deserve it.

Just because he'd chosen me, and I'd chosen to let myself be chosen.

And that was enough.

At least for tonight.

At least for now.

At least for this one perfect, terrifying, impossible moment of believing I could have something beautiful.
