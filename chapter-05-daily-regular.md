# Chapter 5: Daily Regular

By Wednesday, I stop pretending I'm not watching the clock.

The pattern has established itself with the inevitability of the tide. Three o'clock. The bell chimes. Chris Donovan walks through the door, sits at his stool—fourth from the left—and orders a cherry malt with a smile that makes my stomach do complicated things.

Monday: cherry malt, thirty minutes.
Tuesday: cherry malt, forty minutes.
Today is Wednesday, and it's 2:57 PM.

"You're doing it again," Betty says, not looking up from the milkshake she's making.

"Doing what?"

"Staring at that clock like you're willing time to move faster."

"I'm just checking how close we are to dinner rush."

"The dinner rush that starts at five, not three?" Betty adds whipped cream with more force than necessary.

I busy myself rearranging the already-perfect syrup bottles.

Ruth pipes up. "Is he really coming every day?"

"Who?" I ask, too quickly.

"The handsome one with blue eyes."

Betty grins. "Chris Donovan. Every single day for three days. Always sits at Annie's counter. Always orders a cherry malt. Always stays to talk."

"That's so romantic," Ruth sighs.

"That's so nothing," I correct. "He likes cherry malts."

"Annie," Betty says with exaggerated patience, "boys who just like malts don't ask about your favorite songs and art class."

"He was making conversation."

"Exactly! With you. Because he likes talking to you."

The clock strikes three and the bell chimes, and my heart leaps before I can stop it.

Chris walks in, clearly straight from the hardware store. Today his sleeves are rolled up, sawdust on his pants. When he sees me, his whole face lights up.

"Hi, Annie."

The way he says my name still makes me feel like I'm standing on unsteady ground.

"Hi." I'm already reaching for a glass. "Cherry malt?"

"You know me so well already." He settles onto his stool. "Though at this rate, I'm going to turn into a cherry malt."

"There are worse fates," I say, and am rewarded with his laugh.

I make the malt with practiced efficiency now, no longer nervous about the process but still wanting to get it exactly right. Two and a half scoops. Cold milk. Four pumps—my secret ratio. Twenty-five seconds, counted carefully.

When I set it in front of him, he takes a sip and closes his eyes briefly, like he's savoring it. "Perfect. Again. Do you ever make a bad malt?"

"Not if I can help it."

"See, that's the difference between someone who cares about their work and someone who's just putting in time." He gestures with his straw. "I guarantee you I could work at that hardware store for ten years and still not care about the difference between a Phillips head and a flathead screwdriver the way you care about getting the cherry syrup ratio right."

"You don't like working there." It's not a question.

Chris pauses mid-sip, and something flickers across his face—surprise, maybe, that I noticed. "Is it that obvious?"

"A little." I wipe down the counter even though it doesn't need it, giving my hands something to do. "You never sound excited when you talk about it. Not like when you mentioned college, or books, or..." I trail off, realizing I'm probably overstepping.

"Or?" he prompts gently.

"I don't know. Other things." I feel my face heat up. "Sorry. It's not my business."

"No, you're right." He takes another sip, more slowly this time. "I don't like it much. It's just... it's the family business. My dad, my grandfather, my great-grandfather—they all worked there. It's what Donovan men do. And it's a good business. Stable. Respectable."

"But not what you want."

"But not what I want," he agrees quietly.

There's a moment of understanding between us, something that feels bigger than cherry malts and afternoon conversations. We're both trapped by expectations—his by family legacy, mine by the belief that I don't deserve anything more than what I have.

"What would you want?" I ask. "If you could do anything?"

"I told you—teach. High school English, probably. Help kids fall in love with books the way my teachers helped me." His eyes get a distant look, like he's imagining it. "Maybe coach the debate team. Run a book club. Create a space where ideas matter and kids can figure out who they want to be."

The passion in his voice is unmistakable. This isn't a vague dream—it's something he's thought about deeply, something that matters to him.

"That sounds perfect for you," I say honestly.

"Yeah?" He looks at me hopefully, like my opinion actually matters.

"Yeah. You'd be good at it. You're patient, and you actually listen when people talk, and you make things seem interesting even when they're not. Like paint colors and screw sizes."

He laughs. "High praise. 'Chris Donovan: Can Make Even Hardware Interesting.'"

"I'm serious."

"I know." His smile softens. "Thank you."

A customer calls for Betty's attention, and the moment shifts. But Chris doesn't leave. He nurses his cherry malt, and we fall into easier conversation—he tells me about a mishap at the store involving a confused elderly man and a complicated door hinge, I tell him about the toddler who insisted on tasting every ice cream flavor before choosing vanilla.

At some point, I realize we've been talking for over forty minutes. The shop has gotten busier around us, but Chris sits at his stool like an island of calm, and I keep finding excuses to stay at his end of the counter instead of moving along to other customers.

"You're popular today," Mr. Henderson observes, passing by with the cash drawer. There's something in his tone—not disapproval, but maybe amusement.

"Sorry, I should—"

"It's fine, Annie. Betty and Ruth have the others covered." He glances at Chris, then back at me. "Nice to see regular customers."

He moves on before I can respond, but I catch the slight smile on his face.

"Am I getting you in trouble?" Chris asks, concerned.

"No. Mr. Henderson's fair. If he thought I was slacking, he'd say so directly." I hesitate, then admit, "You are here a lot, though."

"Too much?"

"No!" The word comes out too quickly, too emphatic. I try to recover. "I mean, you're a customer. Customers can come in as much as they want."

"But I'm not really just a customer anymore, am I?" His blue eyes meet mine directly, and there's a question in them that makes my heart race.

I don't know how to answer that. What is he, if not a customer? A friend? Something else?

"You're..." I struggle for words. "You're someone who really likes cherry malts?"

He laughs, but there's something else in his expression—maybe disappointment that I'm still deflecting. "I do really like cherry malts. But that's not the only reason I keep coming back, Annie."

My breath catches. "It's not?"

"No." He holds my gaze for a long moment. "It's really not."

Before I can figure out how to respond to that—before I can process what he's actually saying—Betty appears at my elbow with an urgent expression.

"Annie, Ruth needs help in the back. Something about the ice cream freezer making a weird noise."

It's probably not urgent. It's probably Betty giving me an exit from a conversation that's veering into territory that terrifies me. But I take the escape gratefully.

"I should—"

"Of course. Go." Chris's smile is understanding. "I need to get back to the store anyway. My break ended about twenty minutes ago."

He's stayed twenty minutes past his break. For me.

I watch him finish his malt, leave money on the counter with his usual generous tip, and stand. He pushes the stool in carefully, the same courtesy as always.

"Same time tomorrow?" he asks, and it feels like a promise and a question all at once.

"I'll be here."

"Good." That smile again, the one that makes me feel seen. "I'll be here too."

He leaves, and I stand at the counter holding his empty glass, trying to make sense of the conversation we just had.

"He basically just told you he likes you," Betty hisses, appearing the second the door closes. "You know that, right?"

"He said he likes coming here."

"Annie. Annie. He said the malt isn't the only reason he keeps coming back. That means he's coming back for you."

"Maybe he likes the atmosphere. The jukebox. The—"

"Oh my God, you're going to make me crazy." Betty grabs my shoulders and looks me directly in the eyes. "Chris Donovan is coming here every day, staying longer each time, telling you personal things about his life, and basically declaring that he's interested in you. Can you please, please just accept that?"

"But why would he—"

"Because you're smart and talented and sweet, and when you actually talk to people instead of hiding behind the counter, you're genuinely interesting! Why wouldn't he like you?"

I don't have an answer for that. Or rather, I have too many answers—I'm plain, I'm boring, I'm not like the girls he should be interested in, I'm just the malt shop girl with the careful hands.

Ruth pokes her head out from the back room. "The freezer's actually fine. It was just making that normal humming sound."

"See?" I look at Betty pointedly. "False alarm."

Betty just shakes her head, but she's smiling. "Hopeless. You're absolutely hopeless."

Maybe I am.

But that night, lying in bed with my window open and the sound of distant waves filling my small room, I let myself think about what Chris said.

*That's not the only reason I keep coming back.*

I think about the way he looks at me, like I'm someone worth seeing. The way he asks questions and listens to the answers. The way he's made himself a fixture in my afternoons, as reliable as the tide, as steady as the turning clock.

Three days. It's only been three days.

But already, three o'clock has become my favorite time of day.

Already, I find myself thinking about him when I should be thinking about other things—wondering what he's doing at the hardware store, whether Mrs. Patterson finally chose a white paint color, if he's counting down the minutes until he can take his break the same way I'm counting them until he arrives.

Already, the shape of my summer has changed, reorganized itself around the gravitational pull of a boy who orders cherry malts and makes me feel like maybe, just maybe, I'm not as invisible as I thought.

Betty's right. I am hopeless.

But for the first time in my life, being hopeless feels a little bit like hope.
