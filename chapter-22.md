# Chapter 22: Fleeing to Safety

The malt shop felt like a cocoon in the darkness—familiar, safe, mine.

I sat at the counter where I'd spent countless hours making perfect malts and sundaes, where I'd learned every regular's order and their small stories, where I'd sketched on napkins during slow afternoons and dreamed small, careful dreams that never reached too far.

This was the only place in the world where I knew exactly who I was supposed to be.

My hands trembled as I set Diane's pearls on the chrome counter, watching them catch the faint moonlight. They looked expensive and out of place here, just like I'd looked expensive and out of place at the Summer Social. Borrowed beauty, borrowed confidence, borrowed dreams.

All of it a lie.

I could still hear Jennifer's laugh echoing in my head. *Bringing the help to the Summer Social*. Said like it was a joke, like I was a joke. The malt shop girl who'd gotten ideas above her station, who'd let herself believe she could be something more.

The worst part was that they hadn't been cruel about it. That's what made it so much harder to bear—the casual dismissal, the easy assumption that of course I didn't really belong there. Of course Chris was just being kind to the less fortunate. Of course this was charity, not romance.

They hadn't been mean. They'd just been honest.

My reflection stared back at me from the chrome counter—mascara smudged beneath my eyes, lipstick faded, hair coming loose from the careful style Diane had created. I looked like Cinderella after midnight, the magic worn off, the costume revealed for what it was.

Just a girl in a secondhand dress who'd forgotten her place.

I picked up one of the clean rags from beside the sink and wiped at my eyes, smearing makeup across the white cotton. Mama would be disappointed when she saw the dress, saw that I'd run away instead of enduring. Diane would give me that look of pity mixed with exasperation, the one that said she'd expected better.

And Chris...

My chest tightened. What would Chris think when he realized I'd left? Would he be embarrassed that his date had disappeared? Would he make excuses to Sandra and Tommy and his mother—*sorry, she wasn't feeling well, you know how it is*—while they all exchanged knowing looks?

Or would he be relieved?

Maybe this was easier for everyone. Now he could go back to the dance, find a girl who actually fit in that world, someone like Sandra who knew the right things to say and wore the right clothes and didn't need anyone to explain which fork to use or how to move through those spaces without shrinking into herself.

Someone who belonged.

I'd done him a favor, really. Saved him from a summer mistake that would have become increasingly awkward as it went on. Better to end it now, before anyone got too attached. Before I got too attached.

Except I already was attached. That was the problem.

I'd tried so hard not to hope, tried to keep Chris at arm's length, tried to protect myself from exactly this outcome. But somewhere along the way—between the cherry malts and the jukebox songs and the conversations about art school and teaching and being brave enough to want more—I'd let myself fall.

I'd fallen for a boy who was kind to everyone, who included the kids others ignored, who had such a generous spirit.

And I'd mistaken that kindness for something it wasn't.

The tears came harder now, hot and bitter. I put my face in my hands and let myself cry properly for the first time, ugly sobs that echoed in the empty shop. No one was here to see me fall apart. No one was here to judge or dismiss or offer polite condolences.

Just me and the ghost of every afternoon I'd spent here with Chris, talking about impossible things, pretending the world outside these walls didn't exist.

But it did exist. And tonight it had reminded me exactly where I stood in it.

---

I don't know how long I cried. Long enough that my throat was raw and my eyes burned. Long enough that the tears finally stopped coming, leaving just hollow exhaustion in their wake.

I lifted my head from my arms and stared at the jukebox in the corner, silent and dark. How many songs had Chris played for me? *Earth Angel*, *Dream Lover*, *All I Have to Do Is Dream*. He'd created a soundtrack for us, had made the malt shop feel like our own private world.

But private worlds don't matter when you have to live in the real one.

I should go home. Face Mama's questions and Daddy's concerned looks. Return Diane's jewelry. Try to forget tonight had ever happened.

But I couldn't make myself move. Not yet. I needed a few more minutes in this space, this sanctuary, before I had to go back out into the world that had made its judgment of me.

The sound of footsteps on the sidewalk outside made me freeze.

Then a knock on the door—tentative but insistent.

I looked up and my heart lurched. Chris stood on the other side of the glass, still in his suit, his hair slightly mussed like he'd been running. His face was creased with worry, his eyes searching the dim interior until they found me.

Our gazes locked through the window.

For a moment, neither of us moved. I could pretend I hadn't heard him, could hide behind the counter until he left. Could avoid this conversation entirely and let tonight's disaster speak for itself.

But Chris knocked again, louder this time, and I saw his lips form my name even though I couldn't hear it through the glass.

He'd come looking for me. He'd left the dance—left his mother and Tommy and his entire social circle—to find me.

That had to mean something.

Or maybe he just felt responsible. Maybe this was more of that generous spirit Sandra had mentioned, making sure the charity case got home safely.

The thought made fresh tears prick at my eyes, but I stood anyway. Crossed the floor on shaky legs. Stood in front of the door with my hand on the lock.

I could send him away. Could tell him through the glass that I was fine, that he should go back to the dance, that we could talk tomorrow or never.

But I'd run away once tonight already. I couldn't keep running forever.

I unlocked the door.

Chris stepped inside quickly, like he was afraid I'd change my mind. The door swung shut behind him, and suddenly the malt shop felt smaller with both of us in it—him in his formal suit, me in my ruined dress, the careful distance we'd bridged over the summer collapsing back into the space between us.

"Annie." He said my name like a prayer, like a relief. "God, when I turned around and you were gone—I looked everywhere. I thought maybe you went outside for air, but then you weren't anywhere and I—" He stopped, seeing my face properly in the dim light. Seeing the tear tracks, the smudged makeup, the evidence of how badly tonight had hurt. "What happened?"

I opened my mouth but no words came out. What could I possibly say? That his friends thought I was a joke? That Sandra had reminded me of my place with perfect, cutting politeness? That I'd heard myself called "the help" and realized that's all I'd ever be to his world?

"Did someone say something to you?" His voice was getting harder, anger creeping in around the edges. "Sandra? Tommy? Because I swear if anyone—"

"It doesn't matter." I found my voice finally, rough from crying. "They didn't say anything that wasn't true."

"What are you talking about?"

"I don't belong there, Chris." The words came out flat, defeated. "At the Summer Social, with those people. In your world. I never did. I was fooling myself to think I could."

"Annie, that's not—"

"Please don't." I held up a hand, stopping him. "Don't tell me I'm wrong. Don't tell me it doesn't matter. Because it does matter. It matters that everyone there saw exactly what I am—the malt shop girl who got ideas above her station. The help, given a night out as an act of charity."

The words hung in the air between us, sharp and raw.

Chris stared at me. "Is that what you think this is? Charity?"

"Isn't it?" I met his eyes, seeing the hurt there but unable to stop now that I'd started. "Be honest, Chris. You're the boy who includes the kids others ignore. Who's kind to everyone. Who has such a generous spirit." I threw Sandra's words at him like weapons. "That's what this summer was, wasn't it? You being kind to the invisible girl?"

"No." The word came out fierce. "No, Annie, that's not—that's not even close to what this is."

"Then what is it?" I heard my voice breaking but couldn't stop it. "Because from where I'm standing, it looks like you took pity on me. Gave me some attention, made me feel special, and tonight your whole world reminded me exactly why that was never going to work."

We stood there in the darkened malt shop, the chrome gleaming between us, and I waited for him to tell me I was right. Waited for the confirmation that this had all been a beautiful mistake.

Waited for him to let me go.
