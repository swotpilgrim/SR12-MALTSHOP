# Chapter 9: Sketching Dreams

Tuesday brings clouds that threaten rain but never quite deliver, leaving the air thick and humid. The shop is slower than usual—people staying home to avoid the weather, maybe, or just the natural mid-week lull.

Which means I have too much time to think.

The small notebook I've been keeping—the one where I'm saving sketches instead of destroying them—sits in my apron pocket, heavy with possibility. Five drawings now. The view from my window. Betty's profile. The jukebox. Mr. Henderson counting the register. And last night's addition: my mother's hands as she sewed, captured in quick lines that somehow convey both skill and weariness.

I keep touching the notebook through my apron, reminding myself it's there.

Chris asked to see my work. Maybe today's the day I'm brave enough to show him.

Or maybe not. Maybe I'll keep being a coward.

"You're thinking awfully hard," Betty observes,wiping down the counter near me. "Let me guess—debating whether to show Chris your drawings?"

"How do you do that?"

"Do what?"

"Read my mind."

"Because you get this specific expression when you're trying to talk yourself out of something brave." Betty sets down her cloth. "Scrunched forehead, biting your lower lip just slightly, eyes distant. Classic Annie-being-scared face."

"I don't have a scared face."

"You absolutely do. And you're wearing it right now." She softens. "What's the worst that could happen? He's already told you he thinks you're talented. He gave you an art book specifically to encourage you. The boy is on your side, Annie."

"What if the sketches aren't as good as he's imagining?"

"What if they're better?"

Before I can respond, the door chimes. Three o'clock exactly.

Chris enters, shaking moisture from his hair—so it did start raining lightly. He's wearing a different shirt today, green instead of blue, and he's carrying his lunch bag, which is unusual.

"Slow day?" he asks, noticing the nearly empty shop.

"The weather's keeping people away."

"Good. Then you can take an actual break." He holds up the lunch bag. "I brought extra sandwiches. My mom always packs too much, and I thought maybe... if you haven't eaten yet?"

Sharing lunch. That's different from our usual routine, more personal somehow. Lunch is what friends do. What people who care about each other do.

"I'd like that," I hear myself say.

Chris's smile is worth the nervousness fluttering in my stomach. "Great. After the cherry malt, obviously. I have priorities."

I make his malt while he settles in, and then—checking that Betty and Ruth have the sparse customers covered—I pull up a stool on my side of the counter. It feels strange, sitting instead of standing, being on my side of the boundary instead of the service side.

Chris unpacks the sandwiches—turkey and cheese, neatly wrapped—and slides one across to me along with an apple.

"Your mom really does pack a lot," I observe.

"She's convinced I'm going to waste away working at the store." He takes a bite of his sandwich. "Never mind that I'm nineteen and perfectly capable of feeding myself."

"My mother's the same way. Constantly worried I'm not eating enough, even though I'm surrounded by ice cream all day."

We eat in comfortable silence for a moment, and I realize this is what normal feels like. Not serving, not working, just... being. With someone who makes being feel easy.

"So," Chris says after a while, "I've been thinking about our conversation. About you maybe wanting to do illustration."

"I said maybe. That's not a commitment."

"No, but it's not a refusal either." He sets down his sandwich. "I did some research at the library yesterday. There are art schools that offer scholarships based on portfolio submissions. You'd need maybe ten to fifteen pieces—drawings, sketches, paintings, whatever your medium is. And there's a community college program in Wilmington that's specifically for commercial art."

My heart pounds. He researched this. For me. Spent time at the library looking up programs and scholarships because he believes in something I barely let myself imagine.

"Chris, that's... that's really kind, but—"

"But nothing. Just listen for a second." He leans forward, earnest. "You're talented, Annie. Really talented. And talent like that shouldn't be wasted making cherry malts forever—no offense to your excellent cherry malts."

"None taken."

"So I thought, what if you started building a portfolio? Nothing formal, just start keeping your work, refining it, seeing if it's something you actually want to pursue. And if it is, I can help you research schools, application deadlines, all that stuff."

"Why?" The question comes out smaller than I intended. "Why do you care so much about this?"

Chris is quiet for a moment, and when he speaks, his voice is soft. "Because I know what it's like to want something and be told it's impractical. To have dreams that don't match other people's expectations. And I guess... I don't want you to give up on something before you even try. That's what I'm doing with teaching, and it sucks. I don't want that for you."

The honesty in his words hits me square in the chest.

My hand moves to my apron pocket, to the notebook there. This is the moment. This is when I either stay scared or take the risk.

"I've been keeping some," I admit quietly. "Sketches. Like you said in the note. I haven't been throwing them away."

Chris's eyes light up. "Yeah?"

"Just a few. Five, actually. They're not..." I take a breath. "Do you want to see them?"

"Yes." No hesitation. "Absolutely yes."

My hands shake as I pull out the notebook. It's nothing special—just a small spiral-bound pad I bought at the general store, the kind students use for school notes. But inside are five sketches that feel like pieces of my soul exposed.

I slide it across the counter to Chris, then immediately want to snatch it back.

He opens it carefully, like it matters, and studies the first drawing. The view from my bedroom window—the neighbor's fence, the tree branch that scrapes against the siding when it's windy, the slice of ocean visible between houses.

Chris doesn't say anything at first, just looks. Really looks. Then he turns the page.

Betty's profile. Mr. Henderson at the register. The jukebox with its glowing colors. My mother's hands sewing.

He goes through all five slowly, then goes back to the beginning and looks again.

The silence stretches so long I want to disappear.

"Annie." His voice is quiet. "These are really good."

"They're just sketches."

"No." He looks up at me. "They're more than that. Look at this one—" He points to my mother's hands. "You can see the story in this. The years of work, the care she takes, the weariness but also the skill. That's not just technical ability. That's understanding. That's art."

I don't know what to say. No one has ever looked at my work like this, like it means something beyond lines on paper.

"And this one." He's back to the jukebox. "The way you caught the light, the sense of the music being almost visible—it's beautiful, Annie. You have a real gift for capturing moments and making them matter."

"You really think so?"

"I know so." He closes the notebook carefully and slides it back across the counter. "These five? This is a start for a portfolio. You need ten more, maybe, and you'd have something real to show art schools."

"That's crazy."

"Why is believing in yourself crazy?"

"Because..." I struggle to articulate the fear. "Because what if I try and I'm not good enough? What if I let myself want this and it doesn't work out?"

"What if you don't try and spend your whole life wondering what might have been?" Chris counters. "Annie, the only way you definitely fail is by not trying."

"That's easy to say."

"It's terrifying to say, actually." His voice is gentle. "I'm telling you to chase your dreams while I'm too chicken to chase mine. I know it's scary. But at least one of us should be brave enough."

"You think I'm brave?"

"I think you're braver than you realize. You showed me these sketches. You admitted you want something more. That's brave."

We sit there, the lunch forgotten, the shop quiet around us. Something shifts in this moment—not just between us, though there's that too, but inside me. A tiny seed of possibility taking root where there was only doubt before.

"I'll think about it," I say finally. "The portfolio thing. I'll think about it."

"That's all I'm asking." Chris's smile is warm. "Think about it. Keep drawing. Save your work. See where it goes."

"Okay."

"Okay." He picks up his sandwich again. "Now eat. My mom will be offended if you don't finish that entire sandwich."

We eat and talk about lighter things—his morning at the hardware store, a customer who bought seventeen different kinds of nails, the forecast for the rest of the week. But underneath the casual conversation, something has changed.

Chris believes in me. Not just in a vague, supportive way, but actively, specifically, with research and encouragement and genuine faith in my ability.

And for the first time, I'm starting to believe in myself too.

When Chris leaves, he pauses at the door. "Same time tomorrow?"

"Always."

"Bring more sketches if you have them. I want to see whatever you make."

After he's gone, Betty appears at my side. "You showed him."

"I did."

"And?"

"And he thinks I should apply to art school."

"Of course he does. Because he has eyes and you're talented." Betty grins. "You're going to do it, aren't you? Keep drawing. Build a portfolio."

I look down at my notebook, at the five sketches that represent everything I've been too scared to want.

"Yeah," I say softly. "I think maybe I am."

Betty hugs me right there behind the counter, and for once, I don't feel embarrassed by the public display of affection.

That evening, I sketch the shop from the perspective of someone walking in the front door—the counter stretching away, the jukebox in the corner, the red vinyl stools standing at attention. I draw it carefully, taking my time, making it as good as I can make it.

And when I'm done, I don't throw it away.

I add it to the notebook. Number six.

Fourteen more to go.
