# Chapter 12: Chris's Confession

Tuesday arrives hot and heavy, the kind of oppressive humidity that makes even breathing feel like work. The shop's electric fan does little except push warm air in circles. By mid-afternoon, I've refilled the ice bin twice.

When the bell chimes at three o'clock, I look up expecting Chris's usual energy, his easy smile and bright greeting.

Instead, he walks in looking somewhere else entirely. His shoulders are tight, his expression distant. He sits at his stool—fourth from the left—without the usual comment or joke.

"Cherry malt?" I ask, already reaching for a glass.

"Yeah. Thanks." His voice is flat.

I make the malt in concerned silence, counting the familiar twenty-five seconds while watching his reflection in the chrome. He's staring at the counter like it holds answers to questions he hasn't asked.

When I set the glass in front of him, he picks it up and drinks mechanically, without his usual appreciation.

Something is wrong.

I wipe down the counter near him, giving him space but staying close. Betty's handling the booth customers, and the shop is relatively quiet for once. Just the jukebox playing "Only You" and the whir of the fan.

"Chris?" I keep my voice gentle. "Is everything okay?"

He looks up, seeming to register my presence fully for the first time. "Sorry. I'm terrible company today."

"You don't have to apologize." I set down my cloth. "But if you want to talk about it..."

He takes another long drink of his malt, then sets the glass down carefully. "Had a family dinner last night. My dad, my uncle, my older brother Michael. They spent two hours discussing my future like I wasn't even in the room."

"What do you mean?"

"Michael's taking over the Wilmington store next year. My uncle runs the Rehoboth location. And my father..." Chris's jaw tightens. "My father has decided that after I finish my business degree, I'll manage the new store they're planning in Dover. It's all mapped out. My entire life, decided over pot roast and potatoes."

There's bitterness in his voice I've never heard before.

"Did you tell them you don't want that?"

"How can I?" He looks at me, and there's something raw in his expression. "My father built this business from nothing. Worked sixteen-hour days when I was a kid. Gave up his own dreams—he wanted to be a carpenter, did you know that? But hardware stores make money and carpentry doesn't, so he did the practical thing. Built something successful. Built it for us, for the family."

"That doesn't mean you have to—"

"That's exactly what it means." Chris's voice rises slightly, then drops. "He sacrificed for me. Gave me opportunities he never had. Paid for university. And now I'm supposed to say thanks, but no thanks, I'd rather be a high school English teacher making a fraction of what the stores bring in?"

The pain in his voice is familiar. I hear it in my own head when I think about art school, about dreams that don't match reality.

"What's wrong with teaching?" I ask quietly.

"Nothing. Everything." He runs his hand through his hair, frustrated. "Teaching is noble, sure. Important. But it's not... my father would see it as wasting my education. Throwing away the business degree he's paying for. Being impractical. Ungrateful."

"But you love literature. You love books and ideas and—"

"And that's a nice hobby." Chris's smile is bitter. "That's what my father would say. Reading is fine for leisure, but business is for living. Making money is serious. Teaching is for people who don't have better options."

I lean against the counter, understanding clicking into place. "You've never told them, have you? That you want to teach."

"Once. Sophomore year of high school. I mentioned maybe studying education in college." He stares at his malt. "My father laughed. Actually laughed. Said I'd grow out of that idea once I understood how the world really works. And my mother..." He pauses. "My mother looked disappointed. Like I'd suggested something embarrassing."

"So you switched to business."

"So I switched to business." He takes another drink. "Told myself it was fine, I could read books in my spare time, it didn't matter what I studied. But it does matter, Annie. It matters that I sit in business classes thinking about how I'd rather be discussing Hemingway or Fitzgerald. It matters that I'm learning inventory management when I want to teach kids how to think critically about literature."

The shop is quiet except for the jukebox now playing "Dream Lover." The irony isn't lost on me.

"Why are you telling me this?" I ask.

Chris looks at me for a long moment. "Because you understand. You're the only person who might actually understand what it's like to want something everyone else thinks is impractical."

And he's right. I do understand.

"It's different for me though," I say. "I'm just a girl working at a malt shop. My dreams don't—"

"Don't what? Don't matter as much? Don't count?" Chris's voice sharpens with frustration, but not at me. "Annie, you have as much right to your dreams as I have to mine. More, maybe, because you're actually good at what you love. You have real talent. I might just be mediocre at teaching."

"You wouldn't be mediocre."

"How do you know?"

"Because you get excited when you talk about books. Because you explained that poem to me—the Frost one about two roads—and made me actually understand what it meant. Because you see connections and meaning, and that's what good teachers do." I surprise myself with the certainty in my voice. "You wouldn't be mediocre. You'd be the kind of teacher students remember thirty years later."

Chris stares at me. "That's exactly what I want. To be that person for someone."

"Then you should do it."

"Says the girl who won't apply to art school."

The words hang between us—not cruel, but pointed. True.

"That's different," I start.

"How? How is it different?" Chris leans forward. "We're both afraid of disappointing our families. We're both choosing the safe path instead of what we actually want. We're both letting other people's expectations decide our futures." He pauses. "Except you've been

 telling me all summer to be brave. To pursue art despite the obstacles. To believe I'm good enough. And I'm sitting here doing the exact opposite with my own life."

The accusation—gentle but unmistakable—hits home.

"You've been encouraging me," I say slowly, "while ignoring your own advice."

"We both have." Chris's smile is sad. "I've been telling you all the reasons you should chase your dreams while talking myself out of mine. And you've been building a portfolio for schools you think you'll never attend while telling me I'd be a great teacher I'll probably never become."

We sit with that for a moment. The truth of it settling between us like something solid.

"I'm terrified," I admit quietly. "Of trying and failing. Of disappointing my parents. Of being selfish."

"Me too." Chris takes a breath. "I'm terrified my father will look at me like I've betrayed everything he built. That my family will think I'm ungrateful. That I'll regret giving up security for something uncertain."

"But you'd regret it more if you never tried."

"Yes." He meets my eyes. "Just like you would."

The parallel is impossible to ignore. We're mirror images—both trapped between duty and desire, both afraid of the cost of choosing ourselves.

"When did it get so complicated?" I ask. "Knowing what you want should be the easy part."

"Wanting things is easy. Fighting for them is hard." Chris finishes his malt, then adds, "Especially when fighting means disappointing people you love."

Mrs. Henderson calls for a refill from her booth, and I excuse myself to help her. When I return, Chris is looking at me differently. Not with the usual encouragement or light flirtation, but with something deeper.

Understanding. Recognition.

"I'm sorry," he says. "For assuming it was simple for you. That you just needed confidence or encouragement. It's not about confidence, is it?"

"Not entirely." I wipe down the counter between us. "It's about choosing between being who everyone expects and being who you actually are. And living with the guilt either way."

"Yeah." Chris nods. "That's exactly it."

Something shifts in this moment. The balance between us evening out. Before, Chris was the college boy with answers, encouraging the uncertain malt shop girl. But now we're just two people struggling with the same impossible choice, neither of us having figured it out.

It makes what's between us feel more real. More equal.

"For what it's worth," I say quietly, "I think you'd be an amazing teacher. And I think your father would eventually understand, even if he didn't at first. Sometimes the people who love us surprise us."

"For what it's worth," Chris echoes, "I think you're going to apply to art school. Maybe not this year, maybe not next. But eventually. Because I don't think you can keep that much talent hidden forever. It'll push its way out whether you want it to or not."

"Is that what happened to you? With teaching?"

"Yeah. I tried to ignore it, tried to make myself care about business administration. But every time I read something beautiful or taught my younger cousin about poetry, I'd feel this pull. Like there's a version of me waiting to exist, and he's getting impatient."

I understand that feeling. The ghost of who you could be haunting who you are.

"Maybe we're both cowards," I say.

"Or maybe we're both just scared. There's a difference."

"Is there?"

"I think so." Chris pulls out his wallet, places money on the counter. "Cowards never try. But scared people? Scared people show up anyway. They show up and they're terrified, but they do it."

He stands to leave, and I don't want him to. Don't want to lose this moment of raw honesty where we're not playing roles anymore.

"Chris?"

He turns back.

"Thank you. For telling me. For being honest."

"Thank you for understanding." His smile is real this time, tired but genuine. "And Annie? We're going to figure this out. Both of us. Maybe not today, but eventually."

"You sound more confident than I feel."

"Someone has to be. We can take turns."

After he leaves, I stand at the counter thinking about mirror images and parallel struggles. About how Chris isn't the confident college boy I thought he was, and I'm not the helpless malt shop girl he thought I was.

We're just two people trying to choose between safety and dreams.

And somehow, knowing he's as lost as I am makes me feel less alone.

Makes me feel like maybe—just maybe—we could find our way together.
