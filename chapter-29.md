# Chapter 29: The First Kiss

The jukebox had gone quiet, its colored lights still glowing. Chris and I stood in the middle of the floor, no longer dancing but not quite ready to let go of each other.

The silence felt full of possibility. Like we'd crossed some invisible threshold and were standing on the other side, looking at a future that had seemed impossible hours ago.

Chris's hands were still on my waist, gentle but steady. Mine rested on his shoulders, and I could feel his heart beating fast—hopeful and slightly terrified.

"I should probably let you go home," Chris said, but he didn't move. "It's getting late."

"Probably," I agreed, also not moving. "And you left the dance. People will talk."

"Let them talk. I don't care about the dance. I only went because you were there."

Something warm bloomed in my chest at the casual certainty in his voice.

"Chris," I started, then stopped, not quite sure how to say what I was thinking.

"Yeah?"

"Earlier, when we were dancing, you said..." I had to take a breath. "You said something about loving me. Did you mean that?"

I watched his expression carefully, looking for signs that he'd said it in the heat of the moment, that he hadn't really meant it.

But Chris didn't look uncertain or like he wanted to take it back.

He looked at me with complete seriousness.

"I meant it," he said quietly. "Every word. I love the way you notice details about people. I love your quiet strength. I love that you hide your art but save just enough pieces that someday you'll be brave enough to share them. I love that you make perfect cherry malts and care whether Mrs. Henderson is having a good day."

He cupped my face, his thumb brushing gently across my cheekbone.

"And I love who I am when I'm with you. I can tell you the truth about wanting to teach, about being scared of disappointing my father. You listen without judging. You see me instead of just seeing Chris Donovan, hardware heir."

My eyes stung with tears, but these weren't tears of humiliation or pain. These felt like relief, like coming home.

"I've never felt this way before," Chris continued, his voice rough with emotion. "Never felt this kind of... connection. This kind of rightness. Like everything makes sense when I'm with you in a way it doesn't anywhere else."

"Is this what love feels like?" I whispered. "Because I don't have anything to compare it to. I don't know if what I'm feeling is—"

"What are you feeling?" he asked gently.

I tried to find the words. "Like when you walk through the door at three o'clock, my whole day gets brighter. Like when you're not here, I'm looking at the clock, counting down the minutes. Like when you told me about wanting to teach, I felt honored that you trusted me with something so important. Like when you brought me that art book, it was the nicest thing anyone had ever done for me."

I paused, trying to put the jumble of emotions into some kind of order.

"And tonight," I continued, "when I was sitting here in the dark thinking about how I'd ruined everything, all I wanted was to see you again. To apologize. To find a way to make it okay. Because the thought of not having you in my life anymore—of going back to just making malts and watching the days pass without you in them—it felt unbearable."

Chris's expression softened. "Yeah," he said. "That's what love feels like."

We stood there, the weight of that acknowledgment settling between us.

"I'm terrified," I admitted. "Of how big this feels."

"Me too," Chris said. "I didn't expect to meet someone who would change how I see everything."

"What do we do now?"

"Whatever you're comfortable with," Chris said immediately. "We don't have to figure everything out tonight. We don't have to have all the answers. We can take this as slow as you need to."

But I'd been taking things slow my whole life. I'd been careful and cautious and safe, and where had it gotten me? Alone behind a counter, watching other people live the lives I was too afraid to reach for.

Maybe it was time to be a little less careful.

"I don't want slow," I heard myself say. "I want to stop being afraid. I want to stop second-guessing every good thing that happens to me. I want to just... be here. With you. Right now."

Something shifted in Chris's expression—surprise giving way to understanding, understanding giving way to something warmer.

"What do you want?" he asked softly. "Right now, in this moment—what would you want?"

The answer came without hesitation.

"I want you to kiss me."

Chris went very still. "Annie..."

"Unless you don't want to," I added quickly. "I don't want to assume—"

He leaned his forehead against mine, close enough that I could feel his breath.

"I want to," he said, his voice low and rough. "I've wanted to for weeks. But I need you to be sure. I need you to be doing this because you want it, not because you think it's what I expect or because you're trying to prove something."

"I want it," I said firmly. "I want this. I want you. I'm sure."

"Okay," Chris whispered. "Okay."

He pulled back to look at me, his eyes searching my face. Then he smiled—soft and sweet and nervous—and I realized that he was just as scared as I was. That this mattered to him too.

The knowledge felt equalizing. We were both taking a risk here. Both choosing to be brave.

Chris cupped my face in both hands, gentle and reverent. His thumbs brushed across my cheekbones.

"You're beautiful," he said. "Not just tonight in the dress—but every day. In your uniform with your hair in a ponytail, making malts. That's when you're most beautiful."

"Chris—"

But he was already leaning in, slowly, giving me every opportunity to change my mind or pull away. I didn't.

Instead, I stretched up on my toes, closing the last few inches between us.

And then his lips were on mine.

Soft. Gentle. Sweet.

Nothing like the passionate kisses I'd seen in movies. This was simpler, and somehow better—just Chris's mouth pressing carefully against mine, his hands cradling my face, his heart beating fast where our bodies touched.

My first kiss.

I'd imagined being nervous or clumsy. But this didn't feel wrong. This felt exactly right—Chris's lips warm against mine, the taste of cherries faintly on his breath, the smell of his aftershave mixing with vanilla and chocolate from the malt shop.

When we finally pulled apart, it was only by an inch or two. Chris rested his forehead against mine again, and I could feel him smiling.

"Wow," he breathed.

"Yeah," I agreed, a little breathless myself. "Wow."

"Can I do that again?"

I nodded, not trusting my voice, and Chris kissed me once more. Slower this time, more confident, like he was learning the shape of my mouth and I was learning the shape of his.

When we broke apart the second time, I was definitely blushing. But Chris was blushing too, his ears pink, and somehow that made everything okay.

"I have something I want to ask you," Chris said.

"Okay."

"Tomorrow, when I come to the malt shop at three o'clock, I want to do something public. To make sure everyone knows how I feel about you."

My stomach fluttered nervously. "What do you mean?"

"I want to dedicate a song to you. On the jukebox. Loudly. So everyone can hear." His eyes were intense. "I want Sandra Mitchell and everyone else who thinks I was being charitable to know that you're the girl I'm falling in love with."

The nervousness transformed into anticipation mixed with a kind of reckless courage.

"That's going to cause talk," I pointed out.

"Good. Let them talk. Let them see that I'm choosing you, deliberately and publicly." He squeezed my hands. "But only if you're okay with it."

"Do it," I interrupted. "Play the song. Make the dedication. Let everyone know."

The smile that broke across Chris's face was brilliant.

"Tomorrow then. Three o'clock. I'm going to play 'Earth Angel' and tell everyone that it's for you."

"You don't have to—"

"I want to," he said firmly. "No more hiding. No more worrying about what people will think. Just us, being honest about what this is."

I nodded, my heart pounding with terror and exhilaration.

Tomorrow, everyone would know. Tomorrow, this would be real and public and impossible to take back.

But tonight, it was just ours—this perfect, terrifying, wonderful thing we'd built between cherry malts and sketches on napkins, between fear and courage and finally choosing to be brave.

"I should take you home," Chris said reluctantly.

"Yeah," I agreed. "My parents are probably worried."

But neither of us moved.

"One more kiss?" Chris asked.

"One more."

He kissed me again by the jukebox, and I kissed him back.

For the first time in my life, I felt like I was exactly who I was supposed to be.

Not invisible. Not hiding.

Just Annie. Being seen. Being chosen. Being brave enough to believe in her own happy ending.
