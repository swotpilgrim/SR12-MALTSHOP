# Chapter 19: Preparation

Chris's face when I told him I'd changed my mind was worth every moment of fear.

He'd come into the malt shop the next afternoon, settling onto his usual stool with that careful expression he'd worn all week. I'd made his cherry malt without him ordering, my hands steadier than I'd expected, and when I set it in front of him, I didn't give myself time to lose my nerve.

"About the Summer Social," I said. "If the invitation still stands... I'd like to go. With you."

For a heartbeat, he just stared at me. Then his whole face transformed—the carefulness melting into pure, unguarded joy.

"It still stands." His voice was rough with relief. "It absolutely still stands."

"I can't promise I won't step on your feet."

"I don't care if you step on my feet the entire night." He was grinning now, that easy smile I'd missed all week. "Annie, I'm just—I'm really glad you changed your mind. What happened?"

I thought about Betty's fierce encouragement, Mr. Henderson's story about Mary and her unopened paints, Ruth's romantic certainty. About all the people who'd seen something in me worth fighting for.

"My friends convinced me to be braver," I admitted.

"Remind me to thank them." Chris reached across the counter, and after only a moment's hesitation, I put my hand in his. His palm was warm, his grip steady. "We're going to have a great time, Annie. I promise."

I believed him. Or at least, I believed that he believed it. That would have to be enough.

Betty appeared from the back room, took one look at our joined hands across the counter, and let out a whoop that made several customers turn around.

"Thank God," she said, coming over to squeeze my shoulders. "I was about to knock your heads together."

"We have a week to find her a dress," Ruth announced, appearing from the other direction. Apparently, they'd both been listening.

"A week is plenty of time," Betty said firmly. "Annie, what time do you get off tonight?"

"Six."

"Perfect. We're going shopping."

That evening, Betty dragged me through every secondhand store in Seabreeze. We searched through racks of dresses while I tried not to think about my growing anxiety.

"Too old-fashioned. Too short. Too matronly," Betty pronounced, discarding one option after another.

"Maybe this isn't going to work," I said after the fifth store.

"Don't you dare give up." Betty pulled me toward the back corner of Mrs. Chen's shop. "We'll find—oh."

She stopped abruptly and pulled out a dress in pale blue. Fitted bodice with a sweetheart neckline, full skirt, simple cotton fabric. Beautiful in its simplicity.

"Try it on," Betty ordered, shoving it into my hands.

I pulled on the blue dress carefully. When I looked in the mirror, my breath caught. The dress fit perfectly—the blue brought out my eyes, the full skirt made my waist look tiny.

I looked like someone who could belong at the Summer Social.

Betty's eyes went wide when I pulled back the curtain. "That's the one."

Mrs. Chen quoted a price that made my stomach drop. Betty saw my expression and turned to Mrs. Chen with her most charming smile.

"My friend is going to the Summer Social with Chris Donovan. Her first formal dance. Could you possibly give us a better price?"

Mrs. Chen's face softened. "The Palmer girl from the malt shop? My grandson loves your chocolate malts." She studied me. "Half price. But your mother does the alterations."

Half price I could manage. "Deal," Betty said before I could second-guess myself.

My mother looked up when I walked in with the dress box. "What's this?"

"I need alterations. For the Summer Social on Saturday."

Her eyebrows rose. "The Summer Social? That's quite fancy for you, Annie."

The comment stung, but I pushed past it. "Chris Donovan asked me. I said yes."

"The Donovan boy?" She set down her sewing. "From the hardware store family?"

"Yes, ma'am."

She examined the dress with her practiced seamstress's eye. "Good quality. Secondhand?"

"Mrs. Chen's shop."

She held it up to me, calculating. "The hem needs to come up two inches. The waist needs taking in. I'll keep the alterations subtle."

My mother's eyes met mine. Something shifted in her expression—recognition that I was growing up, making my own choices.

"Are you sure about this? People will talk."

"Let them talk," I said, surprised by my own firmness.

A small smile tugged at her lips. "I suppose you're old enough to make your own decisions." She began pinning the dress. "Your father will want to meet this boy before you go. And you'll need some of Diane's jewelry."

"Thank you, Mama."

"Don't thank me yet. These alterations will take all week." But she was smiling.

Over the next few days, preparation consumed every spare moment.

Ruth taught me to dance during breaks, showing me basic slow-dance steps in the back room. "You're overthinking it," she said after I stumbled for the third time. "Just relax and let him guide you."

Betty taught me to style my hair in pin curls until I could do it myself without creating a tangled mess. "You'll need to sleep in the curlers the night before," she warned.

Mr. Henderson watched these preparations with quiet amusement, never commenting on the dance lessons or the hand mirror I kept at the counter.

Chris came in every afternoon, and things between us had shifted back—easy, comfortable, full of deeper conversations. He shared his growing certainty that he needed to tell his father the truth about not wanting the hardware business.

"I've been thinking about what you said," he admitted. "About encouraging me to be brave while being too scared yourself. You were right. I should face my fears too."

"When will you tell him?"

"After the dance. I want to enjoy Saturday first."

I understood completely—holding onto the good moment before facing the scary one.

On Friday evening, Diane stopped by with a box of jewelry. She opened it, revealing pearl earrings and a delicate necklace. "These would be perfect with that dress."

I stared at her. "You're letting me borrow these?"

"Of course. We're sisters, aren't we?"

"I just thought you'd think I was being silly."

Diane was quiet for a moment. "Annie, can I tell you something? Being part of Richard's social circle—it's not as perfect as it looks. People judge you constantly. Sometimes I miss just being able to exist without worrying what everyone thinks."

I'd never heard her talk like this before.

"There's always going to be someone who thinks you don't belong somewhere," she continued. "You can either let that stop you, or you can go anyway and decide for yourself if you care." She handed me the earrings. "Try these on."

I put them on. With the dress and the jewelry, I looked like someone braver.

"I'm terrified, Diane."

"Good. Being terrified means it matters. Just don't let the fear make you miss out on something wonderful."

It was the most honest conversation I'd ever had with my sister.

That night, I lay in bed with my hair in pin curlers, uncomfortable and excited and petrified. In less than twenty-four hours, I'd be walking into the Community Center on Chris's arm, stepping into a world where I'd always watched from the outside.

Betty's voice echoed: You belong anywhere Chris Donovan invites you to be.

Mr. Henderson's: Don't let fear decide your life.

Diane's: Decide for yourself if you care what they think.

I thought about all the people who'd rallied around me this week, who'd had more faith in me than I'd had in myself.

Tomorrow, I would try to be as brave as they believed I could be.

Even if I was terrified.

I was going to that dance.
