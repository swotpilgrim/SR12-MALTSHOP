# Chapter 20: The Summer Social

Diane's hands were surprisingly gentle as she pinned my hair into place.

I sat at my vanity table—really just an old dresser with a mirror propped on top—while my sister worked the magic she'd promised. She'd arrived an hour before Chris was due, armed with bobby pins and hairspray and the kind of confidence that came from years of knowing exactly how to present herself to the world.

"Hold still," she murmured, securing another curl. "You're fidgeting."

I was fidgeting. My hands wouldn't stop twisting in my lap, and my stomach felt like I'd swallowed a hive of bees. In less than an hour, I'd be walking into the Summer Social—the event I'd spent my whole life watching from the outside.

"There." Diane stepped back, surveying her work. "What do you think?"

I looked in the mirror and barely recognized myself. My hair was swept up in an elegant style, soft curls framing my face. Diane had done my makeup too—nothing heavy, just enough to bring out my eyes and add color to my lips. With the pale blue dress and the borrowed pearls, I looked like someone who belonged at a formal dance.

I looked like someone who wasn't me.

"Annie?" Diane's voice was concerned. "You okay?"

"I don't know if I can do this," I whispered.

She sat on the edge of my bed, careful not to wrinkle her own dress. "Cold feet?"

"Frozen feet. Absolutely petrified feet." I turned to face her. "What if I make a fool of myself? What if I use the wrong fork or say the wrong thing or—"

"It's a dance, not a state dinner. There are no forks." Diane's expression softened. "Annie, listen to me. You're going to walk in there on the arm of one of the most eligible boys in Seabreeze. You're going to look beautiful. And yes, some people will judge you. They judge everyone. But the question is: are you going to let that stop you from having a wonderful evening?"

Before I could answer, my father's voice called up the stairs. "Annie! Your young man is here!"

My heart jumped into my throat. Chris was here. It was really happening.

Diane squeezed my hand once. "Be brave, little sister."

I stood on shaking legs, smoothed my dress one last time, and headed downstairs.

Chris stood in our small living room looking impossibly handsome in a dark suit and tie. He was talking to my father about the hardware business, but when I appeared on the stairs, he stopped mid-sentence.

His expression made my heart flutter.

"Annie," he said softly. "You look beautiful."

"Thank you." I descended the last few steps, acutely aware of my parents watching. "You clean up pretty well yourself."

My father cleared his throat. "Now, Chris, what time will you have her home?"

"The dance ends at ten, sir. I'll have her back by ten-thirty."

"Ten-thirty. Not a minute later." My father was using his stern voice, but I could see the slight smile at the corners of his mouth. He liked Chris—they'd been talking about power tools like old friends.

My mother appeared from the kitchen with her camera. "Just one photograph before you go."

We stood together in front of the fireplace while my mother snapped a picture, the flash making me blink. Chris's hand was warm on my back, steadying me.

"Have a wonderful time," my mother said, and for once, there was no edge to her words. Just genuine hope.

Chris helped me into his father's car—a sleek Chevrolet that smelled like leather and aftershave. As we pulled away from my house, I watched my family waving from the porch and felt a surge of panic.

What was I doing? This was Chris Donovan's world I was about to enter, not mine. I was the girl who made malts and drew sketches on napkins. I wasn't someone who went to the Summer Social.

"You're quiet," Chris observed as we drove toward the community center.

"Just nervous," I admitted.

"Me too, actually." He glanced at me with a smile. "I've been to a dozen of these things, but this is the first one that really matters."

"Why does this one matter?"

"Because you're with me." He said it simply, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.

I wanted to believe him. I wanted to hold onto the way he was looking at me right now, like I was someone special. But as we turned onto Main Street and I saw the community center ahead—lit up like a beacon, cars already lining the street, people in formal clothes streaming through the doors—all my courage drained away.

This was real. This was happening.

And I was absolutely terrified.

---

The Seabreeze Community Center had been transformed.

Streamers crisscrossed the ceiling in patriotic red, white, and blue. A live band was set up on the stage, playing a jazzy number that made couples spin across the dance floor. Tables draped in white cloths lined the walls, holding punch bowls and plates of cookies. The lighting was soft and romantic, making everything look like a dream.

Or a nightmare, depending on your perspective.

Chris kept his hand on the small of my back as we entered, steering me through the crowd. I recognized faces from town—Mayor Mitchell and his wife near the punch table, the Hendersons from the yacht club, families I'd served at the malt shop but had never spoken to as anything other than a waitress.

They all seemed to turn and look as we passed.

"Chris!" A boy I recognized as Tommy Brennan waved from near the dance floor. "Over here!"

We made our way over to where Tommy stood with a group of guys I vaguely knew from seeing them around town. They were all in suits, all confident and comfortable in this space in a way I would never be.

"Guys, this is Annie," Chris said, his hand still reassuring on my back. "Annie, this is Tommy, and that's Mike, and Dave."

"Nice to meet you," I managed, my voice coming out smaller than I intended.

"Annie from the malt shop, right?" Tommy said, friendly enough. "You make a mean chocolate shake."

"Thank you." I could feel them assessing me, their eyes taking in my secondhand dress and borrowed jewelry, probably wondering what Chris was doing with someone so clearly out of her element.

A girl in a stunning red dress approached our group, her smile bright and practiced. Sandra Mitchell. Of course.

"Chris! I was hoping you'd make it." Sandra kissed him on the cheek with casual familiarity, then turned to me with polite interest. "And you brought a date. How lovely."

"Sandra, this is Annie Palmer," Chris said.

"Of course. The malt shop." Sandra's smile didn't waver, but something in her tone made it clear she'd placed me exactly where I belonged in the social hierarchy. "What a sweet summer job. Are you enjoying it?"

"It's not just a summer job," I said quietly. "I work there year-round."

"Oh." Sandra's expression flickered with something that might have been pity. "Well, that's... nice."

The band struck up a new song, something faster and livelier.

"We should dance," Chris said, tugging me toward the floor.

"I don't know if I—"

But he was already leading me out among the other couples. I tried to remember what Ruth had taught me, tried to follow his lead, but I was too aware of everything—the watching eyes, the polished girls who moved with effortless grace, the fact that I was clearly, obviously, painfully out of place here.

I stepped on Chris's foot.

"Sorry," I gasped.

"It's fine." He smiled down at me. "You're doing great."

But I wasn't doing great. I was barely keeping time to the music, and when I glanced around, I saw other girls dancing like they'd been born to it, their dresses swirling, their laughter bright and easy.

I saw the mayor's wife whisper something to her friend while looking our direction.

I saw Tommy's date—a pretty blonde in a pink dress—lean close to Tommy and say something that made him glance at me and Chris with a knowing expression.

I saw Sandra Mitchell watching from the sidelines, her perfect eyebrows slightly raised.

They all saw the same thing: a girl who didn't belong.

When the song ended, Chris asked if I wanted punch. I nodded gratefully, relieved for an excuse to get off the dance floor.

He headed toward the refreshment table, leaving me standing alone in my blue dress with my borrowed pearls, feeling like an imposter at someone else's party.

This had been a terrible mistake.

I'd known it would be, had tried to tell everyone, but no one had listened. And now I was here, exposed and judged and so painfully, obviously not good enough for this world.

Not good enough for Chris.

A woman I didn't recognize walked past and gave me a curious once-over, her gaze lingering on my dress in a way that made me acutely aware of its secondhand origins.

I wanted to disappear. I wanted to be back at the malt shop where I knew my place, where I was competent and useful instead of awkward and uncertain.

I wanted to be anywhere but here.

The band launched into another song—something slow and romantic. Around me, couples paired off and began swaying together. I stood alone, waiting for Chris to come back with punch, trying not to look as lost as I felt.

This was supposed to be magical. This was supposed to be the night I stepped out of the shadows and into the light, the night I let myself believe I could be someone who mattered.

Instead, it was just proving everything I'd always known about myself.

I didn't belong here.

I never would.
