# Chapter 13: Bonding Over Expectations

After Chris's confession, something changes in the way we talk.

It's subtle at first. On Wednesday, when he arrives at three and orders his cherry malt, we don't immediately fall into light conversation about hardware store customers or jukebox songs. Instead, after a comfortable silence, Chris asks about my family.

"Your sister, Diane," he says. "You mentioned her once. The one who got married."

I'm wiping down the counter, and my hand stills. "What about her?"

"What's that like? Having a sister everyone compares you to."

The question is so direct, so understanding of what he's really asking, that I answer honestly.

"Like always coming in second in a race you didn't know you were running." I rinse my cloth in the sink. "Diane is everything I'm not—confident, beautiful, socially graceful. She married Richard at nineteen. My mother talks about their wedding like it was the pinnacle of human achievement."

"And you're..."

"The other daughter. The quiet one. The one who makes malts instead of wedding plans." I meet his eyes. "My mother sighs a lot when she looks at me. Like she's wondering where she went wrong."

Chris winces. "That sounds familiar."

"Your family too?"

"Different version, same feeling." He takes a drink of his malt. "My older brother Michael is the golden child. Excelled at business courses, never questioned the plan, genuinely excited about managing stores. Then there's me—reading poetry and asking philosophical questions nobody wants to answer. My father has never sighed at me, but he gets this look. Like I'm a puzzle piece that doesn't quite fit."

"What kind of look?"

"Disappointed confusion. Like he can't figure out where I came from." Chris traces the rim of his glass. "He'll be talking about profit margins or inventory systems, and I'll ask about employee satisfaction or work-life balance, and he just... stares at me. Like I'm speaking another language."

"My mother does that when I mention art. Just this blank incomprehension." I refill the cherry syrup, thinking. "Last week I mentioned that some illustrators make good money doing magazine work. She nodded and then immediately changed the subject to Diane's new curtains."

"Because curtains are real and art is frivolous?"

"Exactly." The understanding in his voice makes me braver. "It's like there are acceptable dreams and unacceptable ones, and nobody told me the rules until I'd already failed them."

Chris nods slowly. "At family dinners, they talk about my future like it's already written. 'When Chris takes over the Dover store...' 'After Chris finishes his business degree...' No one asks what I want. They just assume the path is obvious, and deviating from it would be..." He searches for the word.

"Selfish?"

"Yes. Selfish and ungrateful and impractical." He looks at me. "Do you ever feel like you're watching your life happen to someone else? Like you're playing a role?"

"All the time." The admission feels dangerous and relieving. "I play the quiet, responsible daughter. The girl who doesn't cause trouble or ask for too much. But there's this other version of me—the one who wants to create and try and maybe fail spectacularly—and she's screaming to get out."

"The dutiful son who goes to business school," Chris says quietly, "versus the guy who wants to teach Whitman to sixteen-year-olds."

"Exactly."

We sit with that shared understanding for a moment. The jukebox plays "Only You," and I'm hyperaware that this conversation is different from anything I've had with anyone else.

"I've never told anyone this," I say. "About seriously wanting to pursue art. Not Betty, not even Ruth. You're the only one who knows it's not just a vague maybe. That I actually want it enough that it scares me."

Chris looks up, surprised. "Really? I'm the only one?"

"You're the only one who made it seem possible instead of ridiculous." I wipe the same spot on the counter twice. "Everyone else would tell me to be realistic. You told me to be brave."

"I've never said out loud that I want to teach." His voice is low. "Not since that one time in high school when my father laughed. I've thought it, dreamed it, but never spoken it like a real possibility." He meets my eyes. "Until you."

Something passes between us—recognition, gratitude, connection.

"This is nice," I say quietly. "Being able to say these things."

"Yeah. It really is."

Thursday brings more customers than usual, a tour bus stopping for refreshments before heading to Rehoboth Beach. I'm busy for the first thirty minutes of Chris's visit, making malts and sundaes in quick succession while he waits patiently at his usual stool.

Betty passes with a tray of root beer floats and murmurs, "He's been sitting there for half an hour just watching you work. That boy has it bad."

I flush but don't respond, too focused on getting orders right.

When the rush finally clears, Chris is still there, cherry malt long finished, looking completely content.

"Sorry," I say, sliding a fresh malt across to him—on the house, my treat. "You didn't have to wait."

"I wanted to." He accepts the malt with a smile. "Besides, watching you work is interesting. You get this focused expression, completely in the zone."

"That's just concentration."

"No, it's more than that. It's the same face you make when you're sketching. Total presence." He takes a drink. "My father has that expression when he's working with wood—the carpentry he never got to make a career of. Complete absorption."

"Do you have it? When you're reading?"

"I think so. My roommate at university says I disappear into books. He'll ask me questions and I won't even hear him."

"What do you read? Besides the assigned stuff?"

Chris's face lights up. "Everything. Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Faulkner. Poetry—Frost, Whitman, ee cummings. I love how they use language to capture truth that regular words can't quite reach."

"Like how drawings can show things that photographs miss?"

"Exactly like that." He leans forward, animated. "That's what I want to teach—how to read deeply. How to find meaning. How literature helps us understand ourselves and each other."

"You'd be so good at that."

"You keep saying that."

"Because it's true." I start wiping down the counter, needing something to do with my hands. "You explained that Frost poem—'The Road Not Taken'—and suddenly I understood it wasn't about brave choices. It was about how we create narratives about our decisions later."

"That's exactly right. See? You get it. My students would get it too, if I could just..."

"Break free?"

"Yeah."

We fall into silence again, but it's comfortable. Understanding.

By Friday, I notice that Chris is staying longer—forty-five minutes, sometimes an hour. Other customers occasionally wait while we talk, and I feel guilty about it until I catch Mr. Henderson watching us one afternoon.

He doesn't say anything, just gives me that slight nod he uses when he approves of something. Like he understands that what's happening at the counter is more important than speed of service.

Still, when two booths need refills and Chris and I are mid-conversation about family dinners, I excuse myself hastily.

"I'm monopolizing your time," Chris says when I return. "I should let you work."

"You're not—" I start, then stop. "Okay, maybe a little. But I don't mind."

"Are you sure? I don't want to be that customer who makes your job harder."

"You make my job better." The words come out before I can stop them, more honest than I intended. "These conversations—they're the best part of my day. The part I actually look forward to."

Chris's expression softens. "Mine too. Coming here, talking to you, being able to say things I can't say anywhere else..." He pauses. "It's like this counter is a sanctuary. Like the normal rules don't apply here."

"A sanctuary," I repeat, trying out the word. "I like that."

"Everything outside is expectations and pressure and playing roles. But here? Here I can just be Chris who wants to teach and isn't sure how. And you can be Annie who draws and dreams about art school."

"Our authentic selves."

"Yeah. Exactly."

Betty comes through with dirty dishes, giving us a knowing look as she passes. I expect her to tease later, but instead she pulls me aside during a quiet moment.

"He's good for you," she says simply. "You've changed since he started coming around. You're more... present. More yourself."

"That's the second time someone's said that."

"Because it's true." She loads glasses into the sink. "Whatever you two talk about all those afternoons, it's making you braver. I like seeing that version of Annie."

I think about that for the rest of my shift. About how Chris's willingness to be vulnerable gave me permission to be vulnerable too. How admitting our shared struggles made them feel less overwhelming.

When Chris returns Monday—because of course he returns, five days a week like clockwork now—I'm ready with his cherry malt before he even sits down.

"You're getting too predictable," he teases.

"Says the man who comes here every single day at three o'clock."

"Fair point." He takes his first sip, closes his eyes briefly. "Still perfect."

"That's my job."

"No, your job is making malts. Perfect is just you."

The compliment settles warm in my chest.

We fall into our usual conversation—not the light banter of before, but the deeper honesty we've developed. Chris tells me about a family dinner where his future was planned in detail without anyone asking his input. I tell him about my mother comparing me to Diane while hemming a dress.

"Sometimes I feel invisible," I admit. "Like they look at me but don't actually see me."

"I feel the opposite," Chris says. "Like they see me too much, but only the version they want to see. Not the real me."

"Both sound lonely."

"Yeah. They really do."

But sitting here, talking across the counter with cherry malt glasses and honesty between us, I don't feel lonely.

I feel seen. Heard. Understood.

And from the way Chris looks at me—really looks at me, like I matter—I think he feels the same way.

The malt shop counter has become our sanctuary. The place where we don't have to be who everyone expects. Where we can voice our dreams and fears without judgment.

Where we can just be Annie and Chris, two people trying to figure out how to become themselves.

And somehow, that feels like the most important work either of us is doing all summer.
