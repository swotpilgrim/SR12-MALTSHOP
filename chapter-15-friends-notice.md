# Chapter 15: Friends' Notice

Saturday afternoon brings the kind of crowd that makes the malt shop feel alive. Every booth is full, the counter stools all occupied, and the jukebox competes with the overlapping conversations and laughter.

I'm in my element—making malts and sundaes in quick succession, Betty handling booth orders, Ruth working the register. The rhythm of busy service where everything flows and time moves fast.

Chris is at his usual stool, fourth from the left, nursing a cherry malt while reading a paperback. He knows Saturdays are hectic, knows our conversations will be brief, but he comes anyway. The familiar sight of him has become part of my afternoon landscape.

The bell chimes and three boys walk in. I notice them immediately because they carry themselves with the same easy confidence as Chris—well-dressed in khakis and pressed shirts despite the heat, hair neat, the bearing of people who've never doubted their place in the world.

One of them spots Chris instantly.

"Donovan! So this is where you've been hiding all summer!"

Chris looks up from his book, and something flickers across his face. Surprise, maybe, mixed with something that might be discomfort.

"Tommy. Hey." He closes his book as the three boys approach the counter.

Tommy—tall, blond, with a booming voice that carries—slides onto the stool next to Chris, while his two friends flank the other side. They're scanning the menu but also scanning the shop, taking inventory of everything including me.

"We've been trying to get you to come to Rehoboth for weeks," Tommy says, "and Jenkins said he saw you coming in here every day at three like clockwork. Thought we'd investigate."

"Just getting my cherry malt fix," Chris says lightly. "Annie makes the best ones."

Tommy's eyes land on me, and I feel the assessment. Quick, thorough, categorizing.

"Annie, these are some guys from my high school. Tommy Brennan, Jack Edwards, Pete Jenkins." Chris gestures to each in turn. "Guys, this is Annie Palmer. She works here."

"Hi," I say, forcing my customer service smile. "What can I get you?"

"I'll try one of these famous cherry malts," Tommy says, still looking at me like I'm a puzzle. "See what all the fuss is about."

"Chocolate sundae, extra fudge," Jack says.

"Make that two," Pete adds.

I get to work while they talk around Chris, catching him up on summer plans and mutual friends. Their voices are loud, confident, taking up space the way people do when they've never been told they shouldn't.

While I make Tommy's cherry malt—two and a half scoops, four pumps of syrup, twenty-five seconds exactly—I listen to their conversation despite trying not to.

"Sandra Mitchell was asking about you last week," Tommy says. "At the beach bonfire. Wanted to know if you were seeing anyone."

My hand freezes for just a moment on the mixer.

"Sandra's nice," Chris says neutrally.

"Nice? She's gorgeous. And interested." Tommy leans back, grinning. "You should come to the next bonfire. Everyone's been wondering where you disappeared to."

"I've been around."

"Yeah, here. Every day." Tommy glances at me again, and there's genuine confusion in his expression. "No offense, but this seems like a weird way to spend your summer. We're nineteen, man. We should be at the beach, not..." He trails off, but the implication hangs: not at a malt shop.

I set Tommy's cherry malt in front of him harder than necessary. "One cherry malt."

He takes a drink, eyebrows raising. "Okay, that is actually really good."

"Told you," Chris says, but there's tension in his voice now.

I busy myself making the sundaes, trying to give them space, trying not to listen. But it's impossible when they're right there, when Tommy's voice carries, when the conversation keeps circling back to Chris's summer habits.

"You're missing everything," Pete says. "The parties, the beach, all of it. For what, cherry malts?"

Chris's jaw tightens. "I like it here. It's quiet. Good place to read."

"You can read at the beach," Jack points out.

"It's not the same."

Tommy drinks more of his malt, still studying Chris with that curious expression. Then his eyes slide to me again, and something clicks into place.

"Oh," he says, and there's understanding in that single syllable. "I get it now."

Chris shifts uncomfortably. "Tommy—"

"No, no, I get it. She's cute in that wholesome way. I see the appeal."

My face burns. Cute in that wholesome way. Like I'm a  puppy or a child. Unremarkable. Safe.

"Can we not do this?" Chris's voice has an edge now.

"I'm just saying, I understand the attraction. But man, you could have your pick. Sandra Mitchell is specifically asking about you. That's like winning the lottery and still playing penny slots."

The comparison hits like a slap. Sandra Mitchell is the lottery. I'm penny slots.

I set the two chocolate sundaes in front of Jack and Pete with forced calm. "Two chocolate sundaes, extra fudge."

"Thanks." Jack doesn't even look at me.

I want to disappear. Want to sink through the floor. But I have a job to do, so I move down the counter to help Mrs. Henderson with a refill, grateful for the excuse to put distance between myself and Chris's friends.

Their conversation continues, but quieter now. Tommy has apparently realized he's crossed a line. When I glance over, Chris is explaining something in a low voice, and Tommy's holding up his hands in apology.

They finish their orders and pay—Tommy leaving a generous tip that somehow makes it worse, like charity—and then they're heading for the door.

"Think about Rehoboth next weekend," Tommy calls back to Chris. "The whole gang will be there."

Chris waves but doesn't commit.

After they leave, the shop feels different. Smaller. The magic of the sanctuary Chris described has cracked.

He's still at his stool, staring at his book without reading.

"I'm sorry about that," he says when I return to his section of counter.

"About what? They seemed nice." I keep my voice light, but it takes effort.

"Tommy has no filter. He doesn't think before he talks."

"It's fine. Really." I wipe down the counter between us, needing the motion. "He's right anyway. You should be at the beach with your friends. Not wasting your summer here."

"I'm not wasting anything." Chris's voice is firm. "Annie, what Tommy said—"

"Is accurate." I meet his eyes. "I saw how he looked at me. Like he couldn't figure out what you're doing here. And honestly? I'm wondering the same thing."

"You know why I come here."

"Do I?" The question comes out more vulnerable than I intended. "Because from the outside, this must look strange. College boy spending every afternoon at a malt shop, talking to the girl behind the counter. Your friends think it's weird. They probably all think it's weird."

"I don't care what they think."

"Maybe you should." I fold my cloth, precise creases. "Sandra Mitchell is asking about you. She's from your world and makes sense. I'm—"

"You're what?"

"The malt shop girl." I use Tommy's term deliberately. "The penny slots when you could have the lottery."

Chris's face darkens. "He shouldn't have said that."

"But he did. And he's not wrong." I force myself to look at Chris. "I don't fit in your world. Your friends see that. Everyone probably sees that except you."

"Annie—"

A customer calls for service, and I excuse myself. When I return, Chris is gathering his things.

"I should go," he says quietly.

"Okay."

"But I'm coming back tomorrow. Same time."

I don't know what to say to that, so I just nod.

After he leaves, I feel unsettled in a way I haven't felt all summer. The afternoon passes in a blur of orders and service, but underneath it all is this new awareness: Chris and I exist in a bubble. The malt shop is a sanctuary where normal rules don't apply, where the class difference between us doesn't matter.

But outside these walls? We're mismatched. Improbable. The kind of pairing that makes people like Tommy do double takes.

Later that week, I'm wiping down booth tables when Betty approaches with a strange expression.

"Don't get upset," she says, which immediately makes me tense.

"What happened?"

"I heard some girls talking. In that booth by the window. They didn't know I could hear them." Betty glances around to make sure no one's listening. "They were talking about Chris. About how he's been spending all summer here instead of dating anyone from his usual crowd."

My stomach drops. "What did they say?"

"Just... gossip. You know how people are. One of them mentioned that Sandra Mitchell has been asking about him. Another one said it's weird he's interested in 'the malt shop girl' when he could—" Betty stops. "It doesn't matter what they said. They're catty and jealous."

"Jealous of what? I'm not dating him."

"Aren't you?" Betty asks gently.

"We're friends. We talk."

"Annie, friends don't look at each other the way you two do."

I don't have an answer for that because I don't know what we are. More than friendly customer and server. Less than... what? Boyfriend and girlfriend? That seems impossible.

But now the outside world is intruding. People are talking, noticing, judging. And their judgment makes sense in a way that Chris's attention to me doesn't.

That evening, I lie in bed thinking about Tommy's confusion and those gossiping girls and Sandra Mitchell who apparently represents everything I'm not.

I think about how Chris's friends couldn't understand why he's spending time here. With me.

And the terrible thing is, I don't entirely understand it either.

In the sanctuary of the malt shop, when it's just us talking across the counter, everything makes sense. We understand each other. Our shared struggles and dreams create connection that feels real and important.

But outside that space? We're just mismatched pieces from different puzzles. College boy and malt shop girl. Donovan family and Palmer family. The golden boy who could date anyone and the invisible girl who makes cherry malts.

For the first time since Chris started coming to the shop, I let myself wonder: what happens when summer ends? When he goes back to university and I go back to high school? When the sanctuary dissolves and real life resumes?

Will whatever this is survive outside the malt shop walls?

Or will it turn out to be exactly what Tommy implied—a strange summer habit that doesn't make sense anywhere else?

The doubt plants itself deep, sending roots into all the confidence I've been building. And I realize that believing in myself is one thing.

But believing that someone like Chris would choose someone like me when the whole world is watching?

That's something else entirely.

That might be more than even my newfound courage can handle.
