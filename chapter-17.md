# Chapter 17: Saying No

The napkin with Chris's phone number stayed in my apron pocket for two days.

I could feel it there like a weight, crinkling slightly whenever I moved. Every time I reached for my order pad or wiped my hands, my fingers brushed against it, a constant reminder of the question I couldn't bring myself to answer.

Chris came in both afternoons, punctual as always at three o'clock. The first day, he sat at his usual stool and ordered his cherry malt without mentioning the dance. But when I served it to him, he looked up at me with a hopeful expression.

"Have you had a chance to think about Saturday?"

"Still thinking," I said, which was true in the most technical sense. I'd thought of little else. But thinking about something and actually deciding were two entirely different things.

"Take your time," he said, though I could see the disappointment flicker across his face. "There's no rush."

Except there was a rush. The dance was in five days. If I was going to say yes—which I wasn't, I'd already decided I wasn't—I'd need time to find a dress, to ask my parents, to prepare myself for the terror of stepping into that world.

But I wasn't going to say yes. I'd made up my mind.

I just hadn't managed to tell Chris yet.

The second day, Betty cornered me in the back room during the lunch rush.

"You still haven't given him an answer, have you?"

"I've been busy," I said, which was a flimsy excuse even to my own ears.

"You're stalling." Betty's voice gentled. "What are you so afraid of?"

I set down the whipped cream canister. I was afraid of everything—of wearing the wrong thing, of not knowing how to act at a formal dance. Of everyone looking at me and wondering what I was doing there. Of Chris realizing, in front of all those people, that he'd made a mistake.

"I don't have a dress," I said finally.

Betty's expression turned exasperated. "We've been over this. I can help you find a dress. My cousin Maria—"

"Has a million dresses, I know." I picked at a loose thread on my apron. "But it's not just the dress, Betty. It's everything. I don't know how to dance. Not really. Not the kind of dancing they do at the Summer Social."

"Ruth said she'd teach you." Betty stepped closer. "What's the real reason, Annie? Because these all sound like excuses to me."

The real reason was a tangled knot in my chest. It was years of being invisible, of watching life happen to other people. It was the bone-deep certainty that girls like me didn't get to go to dances with boys like Chris Donovan.

"I'll embarrass myself," I said quietly. "And worse, I'll embarrass him."

Betty was quiet for a moment. When she spoke again, her voice was softer than I'd ever heard it. "You really believe that, don't you? That you're not good enough for him."

I didn't answer. I didn't need to.

"Annie Palmer." Betty grabbed my hands, forcing me to look at her. "You're one of the smartest, kindest, most talented people I know. You make perfect malts, you draw beautiful pictures, you remember every regular's order and what they're going through in their lives. You're—"

"Behind a counter," I interrupted. "That's where I belong, Betty. That's what I'm good at. But the Summer Social? That's different. That's his world, not mine."

Before Betty could argue further, the bell over the door jangled, signaling new customers. She squeezed my hands once more and let me go, but her frustration followed me back out to the counter like a shadow.

That afternoon, when Chris arrived, I knew I couldn't put it off any longer.

He settled onto his stool and I made his cherry malt without him having to order it, the routine so familiar now that my hands moved without conscious thought. Ice cream, milk, cherry syrup, blend until smooth, top with whipped cream. I set it in front of him and wiped my hands on my apron, my fingers brushing against that napkin one more time.

"Chris, about the dance—"

"You've decided." It wasn't a question. He could read the answer on my face.

"I'm sorry," I said, the words coming out in a rush. "I just don't think it's a good idea. I don't have the right clothes, and I'd probably step on your feet the whole time, and I'm not really comfortable at those kinds of events—"

"Annie." He said my name gently, and I stopped babbling. "Is it because of me? Because if you don't want to go with me specifically, that's okay. I'll understand."

"No!" The word burst out more vehemently than I intended. "It's not you, Chris. It's just... it's complicated."

"Can you help me understand what's complicated about it?" He leaned forward, his expression open and genuinely confused. "Because from where I'm sitting, I asked a girl I like to go to a dance with me. If she doesn't want to go, or doesn't want to go with me, that's fine. But you're giving me all these practical reasons that don't quite add up."

A girl I like. The words lodged somewhere in my throat, making it hard to breathe.

"The practical reasons are real," I insisted. "I don't have a dress that would be appropriate for something that formal. My parents might not even let me go. And I really don't know how to dance properly."

"Okay." He ticked off points on his fingers. "Dresses can be borrowed or bought secondhand. Your parents—have you asked them?"

"Well, no, but—"

"So we don't know if that's actually a problem. And dancing?" His lips quirked into a small smile. "Half the people don't know how to dance either. We just shuffle around and try not to step on each other's feet."

But it was fancy. I'd seen pictures in the Seabreeze Gazette—Mayor Mitchell's daughter in expensive dresses, summer people in their pearls and perfectly styled hair, moving through that space like they owned it.

"I just don't think I'd fit in there," I said finally, the closest I could come to the truth.

Chris was quiet for a moment, studying me with an intensity that made me want to look away. "Is this about Sandra Mitchell? Or Tommy and those guys? Because I don't care what they think, Annie. I want to go to this dance with you."

But he would care, eventually. When people started talking, started asking questions about the quiet malt shop girl hanging on his arm. When his parents met me and realized I wasn't like the other girls he could have chosen. When the difference between his world and mine became too obvious to ignore.

"I'm sorry," I said again. "I just can't."

The disappointment on his face was worse than any anger would have been. He nodded slowly, picked up his malt, set it back down without drinking.

"Can I ask you something?" His voice was careful. "Is this a permanent no, or is it just about this dance?"

I didn't understand the question. "What do you mean?"

"I mean, is this you saying you don't want to go to the Summer Social, or is this you saying you don't want to...?" He gestured between us, the movement encompassing the counter and the stools and all the afternoons we'd spent talking. "This. Whatever this is."

My heart felt like it was being squeezed in a vise. "I like talking to you. I like when you come in. I just don't think I'm ready for... for it to be more than that."

"Okay." He exhaled slowly. "Okay. I can respect that." He stood, leaving the malt barely touched. "We can still be friends? I can still come by?"

"Of course." Relief flooded through me, sharp and sweet. He wasn't cutting me off entirely. We could go back to how things were, safe and simple. "I'd like that."

"Good." He managed a smile, but it didn't quite reach his eyes. "I'll see you tomorrow, then."

After he left, I stood behind the counter, trying to ignore the hollow feeling in my chest. I'd done the right thing. I'd protected myself from inevitable disappointment.

So why did it feel so much like loss?

Betty appeared at my elbow. "You told him no."

"I told him no," I confirmed.

"Please don't, Betty. I can't explain it in a way that makes sense."

"You're sabotaging yourself. You're letting fear make your decisions."

"Maybe," I admitted. "But at least I won't get hurt this way."

Betty shook her head slowly. "You're already hurt. You're just pretending you're not."

I wanted to deny it, but she was right. I felt the ache of it already, the loss of possibility, the death of a dream I'd barely let myself have.

But this was safer than the alternative. Safer than watching Chris's regret dawn across his face when he realized I didn't belong in his world.

Even if safe felt an awful lot like lonely.

That evening, I pulled the napkin from my apron pocket one last time. Chris's phone number seemed to mock me. I could call him right now, could take it all back, could say yes to everything I was afraid to want.

I folded the napkin into smaller and smaller squares until the numbers were hidden from view.

Then I tucked it into my nightstand drawer and turned off the light.

The answer was no. It had to be no.

Even if that small, foolish part of me was still whispering what if.
