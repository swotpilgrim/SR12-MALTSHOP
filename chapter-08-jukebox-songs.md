# Chapter 8: Jukebox Songs

Monday comes with the kind of anticipation that makes time move strangely—the morning drags while I count the hours until three o'clock, then suddenly it's 2:45 and my heart is racing and I'm smoothing my apron for the third time.

I spent the entire weekend with the art book Chris gave me. Studied every sketch, read every caption, absorbed the note he'd tucked inside. *Don't throw away your napkins.* Saturday night, instead of crumpling up my drawing of the view from my bedroom window, I tucked it carefully into the book. Sunday afternoon, I sketched Betty's profile from memory and kept it instead of destroying it.

Two drawings saved. Two small acts of bravery.

"He's going to love hearing about the book," Betty says, appearing at my elbow. She's been insufferably smug all morning, like she personally orchestrated the gift. "You did look at it, right?"

"I didn't do anything else all weekend."

"Good. Tell him that. Tell him you loved it."

"I will."

"And Annie?" Betty's voice softens. "Maybe think about letting him see one of your drawings. The ones you've been keeping instead of throwing away."

My stomach clenches. "I don't know..."

"Just think about it."

At precisely three o'clock, the bell chimes, and Chris walks in. But today, instead of heading straight to his usual stool, he makes a detour to the jukebox.

He feeds in a nickel, studies the song selection, then presses a button. The opening notes of "Earth Angel" by The Penguins fill the shop—that sweet, doo-wop sound that always makes me think of couples dancing close, of first loves and summer nights.

Only then does he come to the counter, sliding onto his stool with a smile.

"Hi, Annie."

"Hi." I'm already reaching for a glass, but I'm hyperaware of the music playing. "Starting with the jukebox today?"

"I thought we could use some good music." He settles in, looking pleased with himself. "Besides, I wanted to ask—what are your favorite songs? The ones you actually like, not just the ones that are popular."

The question catches me off-guard. People don't usually ask about my preferences. I'm the one who asks what others want, who serves and facilitates and fades into the background.

"Um." I try to think while starting his cherry malt. "I like 'Dream Lover' by Bobby Darin. And 'All I Have to Do Is Dream' by the Everly Brothers. 'Mr. Sandman' is good too."

Chris pulls out a small notebook from his pocket and actually writes this down. "What is it about those songs?"

"I don't know. I guess..." I watch the pink swirl in the mixer, counting to twenty-five. "They're about yearning, you know? About wanting something that feels just out of reach. There's something hopeful about them, even though they're kind of sad."

When I look up, Chris is watching me with an expression I can't quite read.

"That makes sense," he says quietly. "Those are good choices."

I finish the malt and set it in front of him. "Why do you want to know?"

"Because I like knowing what you like." He says it simply, like it's the most obvious thing in the world. "And because good music makes everything better, and I want to make sure we're listening to the right songs when I'm here."

Something warm unfurls in my chest. He's thinking about the music for me. For us. For these daily afternoon conversations that have become the best part of my day.

"Did you have a chance to look at the book?" he asks, taking a sip of his malt.

"I did." The words come easier than I expected. "Chris, I... I spent all weekend with it. It's incredible. The way those artists captured ordinary moments and made them feel important—I'd never thought about art that way before."

His face lights up. "Yeah? What was your favorite part?"

"There was this sketch of a woman waiting for a train. Just standing on a platform, holding her purse, looking down the tracks. But the artist caught something in her posture, in the way her shoulders were set, that told this whole story about anticipation and maybe worry or hope. It was just lines on paper, but it felt so... true."

"That's exactly it." Chris leans forward, animated now. "That's what great art does—it makes you feel something real about something ordinary. And you do that too, Annie. In your sketches."

"I don't—"

"You do. That drawing I saw you do of Betty? You caught her mid-laugh, and somehow you got her whole personality onto that napkin. That's a gift."

I want to deflect, to minimize, to protect myself from the vulnerability of being seen. But Chris's note echoes in my head. *Don't throw away your napkins.*

"I kept some," I admit quietly. "This weekend. I did a few sketches and I didn't throw them away."

Chris's smile could power the entire shop. "Annie, that's amazing. That's really amazing."

"It's just a start."

"That's all anything is. A start." He takes another sip of his malt. "Will you show me sometime? The sketches you kept?"

Terror and excitement war in my chest. "Maybe."

"I'll take maybe." He grins. "You're getting good at maybes."

"Earth Angel" finishes, and the jukebox whirs as it selects the next song—whatever's queued up in its rotation. It's some upbeat Buddy Holly tune, and while it's good, it doesn't have the same feel.

Chris notices me glancing at the jukebox. "Should I go pick something else? One of your songs?"

"You don't have to—"

"I want to." He's already standing, pulling coins from his pocket. "Which one first? 'Dream Lover'?"

"That one's good."

He feeds the jukebox and selects the song. When Bobby Darin's voice fills the shop, asking for a dream lover so he won't have to dream alone, Chris returns to his stool looking satisfied.

"There. Much better."

Over the next twenty minutes, as we talk about his weekend at the hardware store and my quiet days off, Chris makes three more trips to the jukebox. Each time, he plays one of the songs I mentioned. By the fourth song—"Mr. Sandman"—other customers are commenting on the good music selection.

"Who's picking all these classics?" Mrs. Henderson asks from her usual stool. "It's lovely."

Chris doesn't claim credit, just smiles at me like we're sharing a secret.

Betty sidles up during a lull, keeping her voice low. "He's literally creating a soundtrack for you. Do you understand how romantic that is?"

"He just likes the songs."

"Annie Palmer, I swear—" Betty cuts herself off when Chris glances our way, but her expression says we'll continue this conversation later.

When Chris finishes his malt, he doesn't immediately stand to leave like usual. Instead, he pulls out that small notebook again and flips to a fresh page.

"Can you give me a few more?" he asks. "Favorite songs. I want to make sure I know them all."

"Why?"

"Because." He meets my eyes directly. "When I'm here, I want you to hear music you actually like. Not just whatever's randomly playing. You should get to have your favorite songs, Annie."

Such a simple thing. Such a small gesture. But it means everything.

I list a few more—"Only You" by The Platters, "Unchained Melody," "Tammy" by Debbie Reynolds. Chris writes them all down carefully, like he's taking notes for something important.

"Got it. I'll make sure these are in the rotation." He tucks the notebook away and stands. "Same time tomorrow?"

"I'll be here."

"I know." His smile is warm. "That's the best part of my day."

He leaves before I can process that statement, before I can figure out how to respond to someone saying that seeing me is the best part of their day.

Betty's there the instant the door closes. "Did he just say—"

"Yes."

"And you realize that means—"

"Yes."

"So you're going to stop pretending he's just here for cherry malts?"

I look at the jukebox, still playing "Tammy," one of my favorites. I think about Chris carefully writing down songs, planning what to play next time, wanting to surround me with music I love.

"Yeah," I admit. "I think maybe I believe it now."

Betty squeals and pulls me into a hug right there behind the counter. "Finally!"

The rest of the afternoon passes in a haze. Every time "Earth Angel" or "Dream Lover" comes on—played by regular customers who just happened to pick them—I think of Chris, of the way he asked what I like, of the small notebook where he's keeping track of my preferences.

That evening, lying in bed, I think about the jukebox becoming our language. About how he's taking something public—music in a busy shop—and making it intimate, personal, ours.

I pull out my sketchbook and draw from memory: the jukebox in the corner of the shop, its colors glowing, musical notes floating up from it like they have weight and presence. And there, barely sketched in the corner, a boy feeding it a nickel.

I don't throw it away.

Instead, I tuck it carefully into the art book Chris gave me, between the pages about ordinary moments made extraordinary.

Maybe tomorrow I'll be brave enough to show him. Maybe not. But it's there, kept instead of destroyed, and that's something.

That's a start.
