# Chapter 10: Showing Her Work

The next day, Chris arrives before his usual three o'clock. It's 2:45, and he's walking through the door with purpose, not his usual relaxed stride.

"You're early," I say, already reaching for a glass even though there are still a few customers lingering from the lunch rush.

"I know. I couldn't wait." He sits at his stool, slightly out of breath like he might have hurried. "I have something to ask you."

My heart does that familiar skip. "Okay..."

"I was thinking about your sketches. The ones you showed me yesterday." He's leaning forward, animated in a way I've never quite seen before. His eyes are bright with excitement, and he's talking faster than usual. "And I had this idea. What if you did a whole series? Like, 'A Day at the Malt Shop' or something. You could capture all the different moments—morning prep, lunch rush, slow afternoons, cleanup. Different customers, different times of day. It could be your first real portfolio project."

I freeze in the middle of scooping ice cream.

"That's..." I don't know what it is. Terrifying. Exciting. Too much. "Chris, I don't know if I'm good enough for something that organized."

"You are. You absolutely are." He's completely serious now. "Annie, you capture moments better than anyone I know. These wouldn't just be drawings of a malt shop—they'd be stories. About the people who come here, about you, about this place that matters. That's powerful."

"What if I try and it's terrible?"

"Then you'll have learned something and you'll try again." He says it like it's simple. "But I don't think it will be terrible. I think it'll be beautiful."

The word hangs in the air between us. Beautiful. He thinks my art could be beautiful.

"Think about it," he continues. "You're here every day. You see things other people don't notice. You could carry a small sketchbook, do quick studies when it's slow. Build up a collection over a few weeks. By the end of summer, you'd have a real body of work."

By the end of summer. The phrase reminds me that this—whatever this is between us—has a time limit. Summer ends. Chris goes back to university. Life returns to normal.

Unless I make something of this time. Unless I actually try.

"Okay," I hear myself say.

"Okay you'll think about it, or okay you'll do it?"

"Okay I'll do it." The words feel like jumping off a cliff, exhilarating and terrifying at once. "I'll start a malt shop series. For my portfolio."

Chris's smile is brilliant. "That's amazing, Annie. That's really amazing."

I finish making his malt with hands that shake slightly—not from nerves about him anymore, but from the enormity of what I just committed to. A whole series. Real portfolio work. Actually trying to make something of my art instead of just doodling and throwing away.

When I set the malt in front of him, he raises his glass slightly, like a toast. "To your first real art project."

"It's not real yet."

"It is the moment you decide it is." He takes a sip. "So when will you start?"

"I guess... now?" I look around the shop, seeing it differently. Not just my workplace, but my subject. My canvas. "I could sketch the counter during setup tomorrow morning. Capture the way the light comes through the windows."

"Perfect. And I can be your first customer portrait, if you want. I'm here often enough."

The thought of drawing Chris makes my face heat up. "I don't know if I'm ready for portraits yet."

"Fair enough. But eventually?" He's teasing now, eyes bright with amusement. "When you're famous and people ask who inspired your malt shop series, I want credit."

"You're ridiculous."

"I'm supportive. There's a difference."

Over the next hour—Chris stays longer than usual today—we plan out the series. He suggests different scenes: the morning jukebox selection, Betty serving a booth full of teenagers, Mr. Henderson counting the register, the view from behind the counter during rush hour, close-ups of hands making malts, the empty shop at closing. He describes each one with such enthusiasm, his hands moving as he talks, painting pictures with words.

"You're better at this than I am," I admit. "Seeing what could work."

"I'm just suggesting. You're the one who'll make it real." He pulls out a fresh page in his notebook. "Here, let's make a list. You can check them off as you complete each sketch."

He writes while I dictate, and soon we have a plan: twenty sketches total. More than the fifteen I'd need for a portfolio, but Chris insists having extras to choose from is smart.

"This is really happening," I say, looking at the list. "I'm really going to do this."

"You really are." Chris's voice is warm. "And Annie? I'm really proud of you."

The words settle into my chest, warm and solid. I can't remember the last time someone said they were proud of me for something I chose, something that was mine.

"Thank you," I say quietly. "For believing in this. In me."

"Always."

The way he says it—firm, certain, like a promise—makes me look up and meet his eyes. There's something in his expression that makes my breath catch, something more than friendship or encouragement.

Betty appears at exactly the wrong (or exactly the right) moment, breaking the moment with her cheerful voice. "Annie, Ruth needs help with a milkshake emergency in the back."

It's probably not a real emergency—Betty has a talent for creating excuses to interrupt—but I go anyway, grateful for a moment to collect myself.

In the back room, Ruth is indeed struggling with a milkshake that's too thick, but it's hardly an emergency.

"Sorry," Ruth says. "Betty said to stall you for a minute. I think she wanted to talk to Chris?"

Oh no.

I hurry back to the counter to find Betty leaning on it next to Chris, talking in a low voice. They both look up when I approach, and Betty's wearing her most innocent expression, which means she was absolutely saying something she shouldn't have.

"Everything okay?" I ask, suspicious.

"Perfect," Betty says, too brightly. "Just chatting with Chris about the summer."

Chris won't quite meet my eyes, which confirms my suspicion that Betty said something embarrassing. But he doesn't look upset, just... thoughtful.

After Chris leaves—with repeated encouragement about the art series and a promise to see the first sketches tomorrow—I corner Betty.

"What did you say to him?"

"Nothing!"

"Betty."

"Fine. I may have mentioned that you're always happier after he visits. And that you talk about him constantly. And that—"

"Betty!" My face burns. "You can't just tell him that!"

"Why not? It's true." Betty doesn't look remotely sorry. "Annie, that boy is head over heels for you, and you feel the same way about him. Everyone can see it except you two. I'm just... helping things along."

"By embarrassing me?"

"By making sure he knows you care about him too. You're so busy being scared that you forget he might be scared too. What if he's worried you only see him as a friendly customer? What if he needs to know you like him back?"

The thought hadn't occurred to me. I've been so focused on my own fear and inadequacy that I never considered Chris might have doubts too.

"Do you think he does?" I ask quietly. "Like me, I mean. Really like me, not just as a friend?"

Betty gives me a look that suggests I'm being spectacularly dense. "Annie, the boy researches art schools for you. He brings you books and writes down your favorite songs and encouraged you to pursue your dreams when no one else ever has. Yes. He likes you. So much that I'm frankly amazed he hasn't just kissed you already."

My heart stops. "He's not going to—I mean, we're not—"

"Not yet. But maybe you should think about what you'd do if he did."

That night, I can't sleep. I lie in bed thinking about Chris, about the way he looks at me, about the possibility that this might be real. Not just a summer friendship that ends when September comes, but something more.

And for the first time, instead of being terrified by the thought, I'm excited.

I get out of bed and, by the light of my bedside lamp, sketch from memory: Chris sitting at his usual stool, his hand wrapped around a cherry malt glass, looking at something off to the side with that thoughtful expression he gets. I try to capture the line of his jaw, the way his hair falls across his forehead, the hint of a smile. My pencil moves carefully, trying to remember the exact angle of his shoulders, the way he leans forward when he's really interested in something.

It's not perfect. Portraits are hard, and I'm out of practice. But it's something. It's him. And when I'm done, I don't throw it away.

I add it to my notebook. The first of the malt shop series.

Number seven.

Thirteen more to go.
